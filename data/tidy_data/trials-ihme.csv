NCT01029717,TRUE,NA,CATCH - Catheter Infections in Children,"Most children admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICU) need to have medicines given to them into their veins using a narrow tube, so they do not need repeated injections. This tube is called a central venous catheter. Occasionally these catheters can cause infections in the blood and sometimes the tubes can get blocked by small blood clots. Some intensive care units already use antibiotic or heparin coated catheters, but there is no proof that these are better than the standard ones at preventing infections. Most of the PICU's in this country use standard lines. The only way to find out for certain is to compare children who are given antibiotic or heparin coated catheters with those who are given standard ones in a clinical trial. Because we do not know which type of catheter is best, the type of catheter each child receives in the study will be decided randomly by chance. Each child in the trial will have the same chance of getting any of these three catheters: - Standard central venous catheter (not coated). - Heparin coated central venous catheter. Heparin is a medicine that can stop blood from clotting and might stop the tubes being blocked and infections in the blood. - Antibiotic coated central venous catheter. Antibiotics can be used to kill bacteria which cause the infections. The aim of this study is to see how the three types of catheters compare in reducing the amount of blood infections in children. We will also look at the costs involved. We hope to recruit 1200 children in the UK over 2 years.

NCT00285662,TRUE,NA,Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTi) for the Prevention of Malaria and Anaemia in PNG Infants,"In malaria-endemic areas, young children have an especially high risk of malaria morbidity and mortality. Malaria is estimated to cause up to 2 million deaths and 500 million clinical episodes in Africa alone. The bulk of disease in Africa and severe disease and deaths globally is due to P. falciparum. However, P. vivax is also responsible for a substantial disease burden in endemic regions outside Africa, where P. vivax may account for more than half of all malaria cases. Efforts to reduce this unacceptably high disease burden are hampered by the limited availability of affordable interventions. Following the cessation of large-scale vector control in highly endemic areas, malaria control efforts have centred on early diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases and reducing exposure through the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). While ITNs have been shown to significantly reduce the burden of malaria additional effective interventions are urgently needed. Several trials have shown that chemoprophylaxis given to children at weekly or fortnightly intervals reduces morbidity from malaria in a number of different settings and populations. An alternative approach has been to use intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) involving the administration of a full therapeutic dose of antimalarials at regular intervals. This is logistically easier to deliver, and is less costly, and may reduce problems of promoting drug resistance associated with regular chemoprophylaxis. Intermittent administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) during antenatal clinic visits was shown to be highly effective in reducing malaria and anaemia in pregnant women and improving infant birth weights.

NCT00272142,TRUE,NA,"Impact of Zinc Supplementation in Low Birth Weight Infants on Severe Morbidity, Mortality and Zinc Status: A Randomized Controlled Trial","There are currently no interventions available to substantially reduce the incidence of low birth weight (LBW) apart from increasing the age at marriage, maternal iron supplementation and possibly improved energy intakes. The current view of the medical and public health community in India is that the immediate focus should be on promoting survival and development of low birth weight infants who have nearly a 6 to 7 fold higher mortality during infancy than those with normal birth weight. Low serum zinc is associated with increased incidence of diarrhea and pneumonia. There is sufficient evidence in under-threes that during acute illness, zinc supplementation (1-2 recommended dietary allowance [RDA]) reduces incidence of all episodes of diarrhea, severe diarrhea and pneumonia. A number of initial published trials also show significant effect of zinc treatment on pneumonia. With the large and consistent effects of zinc supplementation on the incidence and severity of infections, an effect on child mortality is likely. Available literature suggests the distinct possibility of reduced neonatal and infant mortality in LBWs receiving 1 RDA of zinc daily. A pilot study in India showed a 54% reduction in mortality in LBW infants. These findings were based on a very small sample and therefore considered insufficient to change policy. A positive impact in the proposed study will provide an important tool for reduction of infant mortality which is currently stagnant and government acceptance for such a program is likely to be very high.

NCT01142505,TRUE,NA,Wheeze and Intermittent Treatment,"The clinical aim of this trial is to assess whether intermittent montelukast is an effective treatment strategy in preschool wheeze. The mechanisms aim of the trial is to determine whether there is a genetically highly-responsive subgroup of children. In designing this trial the investigators have incorporated several novel aspects. First, parents will be able to adjust the use of oral montelukast to their child's symptoms. This allows the investigators to recruit both ""episodic"" and ""multi trigger"" patterns of preschool wheeze - and control for any change in wheeze pattern during the trial. Second, before the investigators issue the trial medication, the investigators will assess children's leukotriene genes, focusing primarily on a gene called ALOX5. This ALOX5 ""stratification"" step will ensure that an equal number of potentially ""treatment-responsive"" children receive the active drug (montelukast) and the dummy medicine - and the equal numbers will help the investigators to assess the role of ALOX5. For the trial, the investigators will first recruit 1,300 children with a history of preschool wheeze, then divide them into the group with ""responsive"" and ""less responsive"" genes by their ALOX5 status. The investigators will then issue parents with the trial medication; 50% will be given montelukast and 50% will be given dummy medication. Parents will start the trial medication whenever their child develops a cold, and stop the medication when wheeze resolve. Parents will also be able to give the trial medication for wheeze between colds. Over the 12 month trial period, the investigators will assess the number of unscheduled attendances to a medical practitioner for wheeze for each child. At the end of the trial, the investigators will determine whether montelukast is effective then whether there is a difference in response to montelukast between the 2 ALOX5 gene groups. At the same time, the investigators will measure many other genes that may influence response to montelukast, as well as the amount of leukotrienes that are excreted in the urine before and during attacks. Using these results, the investigators will be able to both inform national treatment policy, and develop new concepts on the mechanism of preschool wheeze that will inform the development of new therapies.

NCT00158574,TRUE,NA,Kilimanjaro IPTi Drug Options Trial,"Malaria and anaemia are major causes of morbidity and mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa. Administration of three courses of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) as intermittent preventive treatment (IPTi) to infants when they receive EPI vaccines reduced the incidence of malaria and anaemia in infants in an area with low SP resistance, low transmission pressure and high bednet use. However, it is not clear whether this observation can be generalised to areas with high transmission and high SP resistance. The mechanism of the protective effect of IPTi is unclear. There is an urgent need to identify other anti-malarial drugs that could be used for IPTi instead of SP. This study objectives are: 1. Identification of a drug that could be used safely and effectively for IPTi instead of SP in areas, such as north eastern Tanzania, where there is a high level of resistance to SP and amodiaquine. 2.

NCT02225769,TRUE,NA,Electronic Algorithms Based on Host Biomarkers to Manage Febrile Children,"Health professionals in developing countries have limited ability to identify children at risk of dying and those in need of antibiotics. The main reasons are limited clinical skills and time, unavailability of diagnostic tests (laboratory or x-ray) and non-adherence to practice guidelines. Child mortality is therefore higher than it should be. Etiological diagnostic tests (detecting microorganisms) may not always help since the distinction between infection and disease and between mild or severe disease is not straightforward. Overprescription of antibiotics is therefore widespread and leads to the development of drug resistance. To address these challenges, decision charts for the management of febrile illness will be developed and include i) few clinical parameters simple to assess, and ii) POCTs results based on specific host markers that can discriminate between mild and severe disease, pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections, and unspecific fevers of bacterial and of viral origin.

NCT00131716,TRUE,NA,Prevention of Severe Anaemia in Gambian Children,"Severe anaemia is a frequent cause of admission to hospitals in tropical Africa and about 10% of such children die. In endemic countries, anaemia has multiple causes such as nutritional deficiencies, infections and haemoglobinopathies.

Severe anaemia is usually treated by blood transfusion although transfusion carries the attendant risk of transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Thus, there is a need to explore novel strategies to reduce the incidence of severe anaemia in high-risk groups such as children with suboptimal haemoglobin levels because these children are at increased risk of developing severe anaemia if they develop a malaria infection before their haemoglobin level has normalized.

NCT01350063,TRUE,Randomized by household,Health Impact of Treating and Safely Storing Shallow Tubewell Drinking Water,"When shallow tubewells replaced highly contaminated surface water as the primary source of drinking water in Bangladesh in the late 20th century, contemporary studies demonstrated no reduction in diarrheal disease with this improvement in water source.

The combination of chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate (CDA) is being developed to supersede chlorproguanil-dapsone for the same indication, but the addition of an artemisinin derivative, artesunate, should provide additional population benefits over chlorproguanil-dapsone alone.

The addition of a second agent to the chlorproguanil-dapsone combination should also protect against the selection of resistant strains of P.falciparum. Artemether-lumefantrine is the only available fixed-dose Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy actually available and is considered as the gold standard for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria.

Besides adult health problems such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, obesity in childhood is associated with psychological and social problems, low self-esteem, stigmatization and being teased and bullied by friends. Danish research suggests that the causes behind the increase in obesity occurrence are present already in early childhood, and that prevention of obesity therefore has to start early.

The primary purpose of the algorithm is to prevent mortality due to bacterial pneumonia. However, an unknown proportion of children managed in this fashion will have a viral related wheezing illness or asthma rather than pneumonia.

The effect of IPT in children in the prevention of malaria has been evaluated in a number of trials in areas of seasonal malaria transmission. Results from these trials have shown that IPTc provided between 40% - 86% protection against clinical malaria. In 2006, a trial that compared two methods of IPTc delivery was carried out in Upper River Division, The Gambia. Preliminary results of the trial have shown that the treatment was very effective as only 4% (45/1133) of the children seen at the end of year cross-sectional survey were parasitaemic. Tolerability was assessed in a subset of 1100 children and the results showed that about 13.5% of children developed mild to moderate vomiting. Malaise was present in about 10% of the study subjects. Severe adverse events were rare. Thus it is important to investigate if other drug regimens might be equally effective in preventing malaria but less likely to cause adverse events.

NCT01899820,TRUE,unclear randomization; seems like cluster,Evaluation of the Efficacy of Artemisinin Combination Therapy in Kenya,"Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended for use against uncomplicated malaria in areas of multi-drug resistant malaria. The Ministry of Health, Division of Malaria Control (DOMC) rolled out the use of artemether-lumefantrine as the first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in 2006.The development of the ACTs and its derivatives are the most rapidly acting of all the current antimalarial drugs and recognition of their potential role as a component of combination therapy have led to several large trials aimed at assessing different combinations of existing drugs, and to the specific development of new combination drugs. This proposal aims to (1) evaluate the efficacy of artemisinin-based anti-malaria combination drugs in different sites across Kenya (2) elucidate the markers of resistance to ACTs through molecular genetics and in this process further strengthen capacity in the proposed study sites as well as improve links between research and control ultimately to influence malaria treatment policy and practice. Five groups in East Africa will conduct a multi-centre, randomised, two arm trial to assess the efficacy of dihydroartemisin-piperaquine with artemether-lumefantrine as the comparative drug. The network will determine antimalarial drug efficacy using standardised protocols and collate clinical responses and adverse events. Molecular markers to artemisinin resistance will be investigated by molecular sequencing and comparison of parasite profiles in drug failure cases. Recrudescence or re-infections will be differentiated by analysis of the MSP1, MSP2 and GLURP genes and assess transmission dynamics post treatment.

The Ministry of Health, Division of Malaria Control (DOMC) rolled out the use of artemether-lumefantrine as the first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in 2006.The development of the ACTs and its derivatives are the most rapidly acting of all the current antimalarial drugs and recognition of their potential role as a component of combination therapy have led to several large trials aimed at assessing different combinations of existing drugs, and to the specific development of new combination drugs. This proposal aims to (1) evaluate the efficacy of artemisinin-based anti-malaria combination drugs in different sites across Kenya (2) elucidate the markers of resistance to ACTs through molecular genetics and in this process further strengthen capacity in the proposed study sites as well as improve links between research and control ultimately to influence malaria treatment policy and practice. Five groups in East Africa will conduct a multi-centre, randomised, two arm trial to assess the efficacy of dihydroartemisin-piperaquine with artemether-lumefantrine as the comparative drug. The network will determine antimalarial drug efficacy using standardised protocols and collate clinical responses and adverse events. Molecular markers to artemisinin resistance will be investigated by molecular sequencing and comparison of parasite profiles in drug failure cases. Recrudescence or re-infections will be differentiated by analysis of the MSP1, MSP2 and GLURP genes and assess transmission dynamics post treatment.

NCT02606565,TRUE,NA,Efficacy of Umbilical Cord Cleansing With a Single Application of 4% Chlorhexidine for the Prevention of Newborn Infections in Uganda: a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Nearly all the yearly 3.3 million neonatal deaths occur in low and middle income countries. Infections, including those affecting the umbilical cord (omphalitis) are a significant factor in approximately a third of these deaths. In fact, the odds of all-cause mortality are 46% higher among infants with umbilical cord infection than those without infection. Five large randomized controlled trials in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have examined the effect of multiple applications (for at least 7 days) of 4% chlorhexidine (CHX) on the umbilical cord on omphalitis and neonatal death. These studies show a consitent positive effect of multiple applications on omphalitis but not on neonatal mortality. Whereas there is mounting evidence for the effect of 7 day chlorhexidine application, there is no data from Africa and only one study from Asia that examines the effect of a single application of CHX as soon as possible after birth. In this single Asian study, CHX led to a reduction in the risk of mild-moderate omphalitis and neonatal death. It is important, in an African setting to explore the effect of a single application, which is programmatically much simpler to implement than daily application for 7 days. Therefore, the investigators' study will compare umbilical cord cleansing with a single application of 4% chlorhexidine at birth with dry cord care in both community and facility births on omphalitis and severe illness in the neonatal period. Methods: The chlorhexidine study is a community based, individually randomised controlled trial conducted on 4,760 mother-infant pairs in Uganda.

NCT03181958,TRUE,NA,A Trial Comparing Noninvasive Ventilation Strategies in Preterm Infants Following Extubation,"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the main cause of respiratory failure in preterm neonates, its incidence varying from 80% to 25% depending on gestational age.When optimal prenatal care is provided, the best approach to treat RDS, according to several recent trials,consists in providing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) from the first minutes of life using short binasal prongs or masks, followed by early selective surfactant administration for babies with worsening oxygenation and/or increasing work of breathing. Any effort should be done to minimize the time under invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).Nonetheless, clinical trials have shown that a relevant proportion of preterm neonates fails this approach and eventually need IMV.The duration of IMV is a well known risk factor for the development of broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD) - a condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. To minimize the duration of IMV, various non invasive respiratory support modalities are available in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). CPAP is presently the most common technique used in this regard. However, a systematic review has shown that non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) reduces the need for IMV (within one week from extubation) more effectively than NCPAP, although it is not clear if NIPPV may reduce need for intubation longterm and it seems to have no effect on BPD and mortality. NIPPV main drawback is the lack of synchronization, which is difficult to be accurately achieved and is usually unavailable. A more recent alternative technique is non-invasive high frequency oscillatory ventilation (NHFOV) which consists on the application of a bias flow generating a continuous distending positive pressure with oscillations superimposed on spontaneous tidal breathing with no need for synchronization. The physiological, biological and clinical details about NHFOV have been described elsewhere. To date, there is only one small observational uncontrolled study about the use of NHFOV after extubation in preterm infants. Other relatively small case series or retrospective cohort studies suggested safety, feasibility and possible usefulness of NHFOV and have been reviewed elsewhere.The only randomized trial published so far compared NHFOV to biphasic CPAP,in babies failing CPAP and it has been criticized for methodological flaws and for not taking into account respiratory physiology.An European survey showed that, despite the absence of large randomized clinical trials, NHFOV is quite widely used, at least in some Countries and no major side effects are reported, although large data about NHFOV safety are lacking. This may be due to the relative NHFOV easiness of use but evidence-based and physiology-driven data are warranted about this technique.",Nasal High Frequency Oscillation Ventilation(NHFOV) vs. Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure(NCPAP) vs Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation（NIPPV） as Post-extubation Respiratory Support in Preterm Infants With Respiratory Distress Syndrome:a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,Intubated Infants Were Intend to Extubation Using Noninvasive Ventilation Strategies,TRUE,76,88,89,962,380,1,1,1440,<5,up to 1 Month (Child),FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,China,China,China,China,Chongqing,"Shi Yuan, PhD,MD",Daping Hospital and the Research Institute of Surgery of the Third Military Medical University,Chongqing,Chongqing Medical Research Unit,industry,Other|Industry,NA,31349833,NA,NA,NA,0,31349833,"Shi Y, De Luca D; NASal OscillatioN post-Extubation (NASONE) study group.

Any effort should be done to minimize the time under invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).Nonetheless, clinical trials have shown that a relevant proportion of preterm neonates fails this approach and eventually need IMV.The duration of IMV is a well known risk factor for the development of broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD) - a condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. To minimize the duration of IMV, various non invasive respiratory support modalities are available in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). CPAP is presently the most common technique used in this regard. However, a systematic review has shown that non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) reduces the need for IMV (within one week from extubation) more effectively than NCPAP, although it is not clear if NIPPV may reduce need for intubation longterm and it seems to have no effect on BPD and mortality. NIPPV main drawback is the lack of synchronization, which is difficult to be accurately achieved and is usually unavailable. A more recent alternative technique is non-invasive high frequency oscillatory ventilation (NHFOV) which consists on the application of a bias flow generating a continuous distending positive pressure with oscillations superimposed on spontaneous tidal breathing with no need for synchronization. The physiological, biological and clinical details about NHFOV have been described elsewhere. To date, there is only one small observational uncontrolled study about the use of NHFOV after extubation in preterm infants. Other relatively small case series or retrospective cohort studies suggested safety, feasibility and possible usefulness of NHFOV and have been reviewed elsewhere.The only randomized trial published so far compared NHFOV to biphasic CPAP,in babies failing CPAP and it has been criticized for methodological flaws and for not taking into account respiratory physiology.An European survey showed that, despite the absence of large randomized clinical trials, NHFOV is quite widely used, at least in some Countries and no major side effects are reported, although large data about NHFOV safety are lacking. This may be due to the relative NHFOV easiness of use but evidence-based and physiology-driven data are warranted about this technique.",NA,medical_device,NA,Treatment,duration of invasive mechanical ventilation; ventilator-free days; the number of reintubation,non-mortality,airleaks; bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD); Retinopathy of prematurity> 2nd stage; Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis≥ 2nd stage; Intraventricular hemorrhage>2nd grade; need for postnatal steroids; in-hospital mortality; composite mortality/BPD; Weekly weight gain; haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),composite,2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,42883,NA,43668,less_developed

NCT02112734,TRUE,NA,Can Vitamin D Supplementation in Infants Prevent Food Allergy in the First Year of Life? The VITALITY Trial,"There is an urgent need to prevent the onset and progression of food allergy in our population. Evidence demonstrates that food allergy and atopic eczema represent the earliest manifestations of the atopic march with 50% of infants with food allergy predicted to develop respiratory allergic diseases later in life. We report that Australia has the highest prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the world, with 10% of infants having challenge-proven food allergy in Melbourne. There has been a 5-fold increase in hospital admissions for life-threatening anaphylaxis. These changes are most pronounced in children less than 5 years, suggesting a causal role for early life determinants. We have primary data to inform hypotheses for the rise in food allergy, which appears to result from potentially modifiable factors related to the modern lifestyle, particularly Vitamin D insufficiency (VDI), and have demonstrated an association between VDI and increased risk of challenge-proven food allergy in 12-month old infants, which supports numerous ecological studies showing an increased risk of food allergy the further a child resides from the equator (associated with decreased UV exposure and Vitamin D levels). Despite Australia's sunny climate, population rates of VDI have steadily increased in infants and pregnant women in parallel to the apparent rise in food allergic disease. This association is biologically plausible, as there is evidence Vitamin D is critical to the healthy development of the immune system in early life. We propose an intervention study to assess if infant Vitamin D supplementation during the first year of life significantly decreases the risk of early-onset food allergy. Australia is ideally placed to answer this important question since, unlike the USA, Canada and Europe, there are no population recommendations for routine infant supplementation with Vitamin D and we are one of the few developed countries that do not supplement the food chain supply with Vitamin D.",Can Vitamin D Supplementation in Infants Prevent Food Allergy in the First Year of Life?

NCT03640403,TRUE,NA,Effectiveness and Safety of Intermittent Preventive Treatment for Malaria Using Either Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or Artesunate-amodiaquine in Reducing Malaria Related Morbidities and Improving Cognitive Ability in School-aged Children in Tanzania,"Background: In high-transmission settings, up to 70% of school-aged children harbour malaria parasites which is mostly asymptomatic, thus, from an epidemiological point of view, they contribute significantly as reservoir to onward malaria transmission to others. In endemic areas, malaria accounts for around 50% of the mortality, 13-50% of all school absenteeism, and causes anaemia in approximately 85 million school-aged children of sub Saharan Africa that also impairs the cognitive development of children. Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of pregnant women as well as seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children under the age of five have been implemented in several sub-Saharan countries and have proven to be very effective. However, none of these IPT strategies is targeting school children. A clinical trial is being conducted to expand the IPT by testing effectiveness and safety of two antimalarial drugs Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) in preventing malaria related morbidity in school aged children (IPTsc) living in high endemic areas. Methods: A randomized, open label, controlled trial will enrol 1602 school children aged 5-15 years, who will receive either DP or ASAQ or control (no drug ), using a ""balanced block design"" with the ""standard of care"" arm as reference. The interventional treatments are given every 4 months 3 rounds for the first year. A second non-interventional year will assess possible rebound effects. All study-arms receive bed nets, early diagnosis and care for malaria, and praziquantel and albendazole as mass treatment for helminthiasis.

NCT04104555,TRUE,NA,Orthotics for Treatment of Symptomatic Flat Feet in Children,"As a child grows the shape of their foot changes and most develop an arch in their foot. For some, however, the arch does not fully form or it might be flat against the ground. When this happens, it is known as having flat feet which can cause pain in the feet, legs, or back. At the moment, we are not sure what the best treatment for flat feet is, so the purpose of this research is to conduct a trial to compare three of the most common treatments that are used today. Two of the treatments are different types of insoles, which are put inside the shoe. The third treatment is some exercises and advice about which types of shoes might help. Participants will receive their treatment as part of their normal National Health System care. We would like 1055 children and young people aged between six and 16 years old to take part in the study. Everyone will receive advice about the type of shoes to wear, ankle exercises and things to look out for when children have painful flat feet. In addition to this, 422 of the participants will receive an insole that is individually customised for them, whilst another 422 will receive a pre-made insole that is the right size. We will ask for their help for 12 months. During this time, we will track their progress by sending them three questionnaires in the post to fill in and weekly text messages to find out how painful their feet are during the first few months. We also want to learn more about the problems that flat feet cause, and children's experiences of the treatments delivered as part of this clinical trial. We will explore this through in-depth conversations with children and their parent(s) or the person who looks after them. Once we have finished the trial, we will work with the people who took part in the trial, and clinicians, to make sure that our results can be used by as many people as possible. In addition to the main OSTRICH study we will run three additional studies.

For some, however, the arch does not fully form or it might be flat against the ground. When this happens, it is known as having flat feet which can cause pain in the feet, legs, or back. At the moment, we are not sure what the best treatment for flat feet is, so the purpose of this research is to conduct a trial to compare three of the most common treatments that are used today. Two of the treatments are different types of insoles, which are put inside the shoe. The third treatment is some exercises and advice about which types of shoes might help. Participants will receive their treatment as part of their normal National Health System care. We would like 1055 children and young people aged between six and 16 years old to take part in the study. Everyone will receive advice about the type of shoes to wear, ankle exercises and things to look out for when children have painful flat feet. In addition to this, 422 of the participants will receive an insole that is individually customised for them, whilst another 422 will receive a pre-made insole that is the right size. We will ask for their help for 12 months. During this time, we will track their progress by sending them three questionnaires in the post to fill in and weekly text messages to find out how painful their feet are during the first few months. We also want to learn more about the problems that flat feet cause, and children's experiences of the treatments delivered as part of this clinical trial. We will explore this through in-depth conversations with children and their parent(s) or the person who looks after them. Once we have finished the trial, we will work with the people who took part in the trial, and clinicians, to make sure that our results can be used by as many people as possible. In addition to the main OSTRICH study we will run three additional studies. The first will find out if including a pen and having information about the study in the form of a video in addition to information in a paper booklet will increase the number of participants who take part in the study.

It is generally acknowledged that breastfeeding is one of the main pillars in allergy prevention. Infant formulas based on hydrolysed proteins have been developed to be used by infants at increased risk of developing allergy in case a mother is unable or chooses not to breastfeed her infant. The effect of hydrolysed formula in allergy prevention has been examined in many studies, from which it can be concluded that currently there is not sufficient evidence to support hydrolysed protein over intact protein for allergy risk reduction. Moreover, several clinical trials support the suggestion of supplementation of pre and/or probiotics for the reduction of eczema development, recognized by international authorities. The present study (MAESTRO) investigates the preventive effect of a hypoallergenic concept combining several nutritional approaches related to preventive strategies: partially hydrolysed protein formula supplemented with prebiotics and probiotics. The aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy, growth and safety of this concept compared to standard (intact protein) infant formula on the development of allergic manifestations up to the age of 12 months in infants at increased risk of developing allergy.","A Randomised, Double-blind, Controlled, Parallel-group, Multi-country Study to Investigate the Effect of a Partially Hydrolysed Infant Formula With Added Synbiotics on the Development of Allergic Manifestations in Infants at High Risk of Developing Allergy",Immunity,TRUE,276,311,311,640,619,1,1,1700,<5,up to 16 Weeks (Child),TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"NA","NA","NA",France,0,0,0,n/a,Nutricia Research,industry,Industry,NA,no_publication,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1700,0,NA,NA,NA,Not yet recruiting,Not yet recruiting,Not yet recruiting,NA,2019-05-03T00:00:00Z,Other; Other,Infant Formula with added synbiotics; Standard Infant formula,"With the rising prevalence of allergic diseases and the subsequent risk of developing other immune-related disorders, primary prevention of allergy has become a major priority.

Acha Mum is well accepted by children in Pakistan and is currently being used as a treatment for children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in targeted supplementary feeding programs (TSFP) throughout the country. The broad objective of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of a chickpea-based specialized nutritious food Acha Mum, compared to a standard RUTF for the treatment of SAM.

NCT00495690,TRUE,NA,Impact of Daily Zinc Supplementation to Infants Born With Low Birth Weight on Death and Severe Disease,"Title: Impact of daily zinc supplementation to infants born with low birth weight on mortality and severe disease requiring hospitalization Background: Zinc supplementation was shown to prevent diarrhea and pneumonia in 6 month to 3 year old children. Little is known about the impact of zinc supplementation of low birth weight (LBW) babies during first 6 months of life. Objective: The objectives were to determine the impact of daily zinc administration at 1RDA (5 mg) of elemental zinc to LBW infants on severe morbidity requiring hospitalization and on all cause mortality. Design: In a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial 2012 hospital-born infants with a birth weight <2500 g were randomly assigned to receive zinc or placebo for 6 months. Zinc group received 5 mg elemental zinc as acetate daily from 4 weeks age. Cause specific hospitalization deaths, episodes of diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, other illness, visits to health care providers and hospital OPDs were ascertained by in-depth interview and from documents like prescriptions, hospital tickets, medicine cartons at 3 and 6 months of age. Results: Number of infants with one or more diarrhea episodes was less by 17% (95% CI: 1% to 35%) in the zinc group but the numbers for ARI were similar in the two groups. The hospitalization rates due to all causes or diarrhea or ARI were similar in the two groups. Twelve in the zinc group and 9 in the placebo group died during 4 weeks to 6 months (p=0.36). We observed no significant difference for gain in weight and length at 3 months and 6 months between the groups. In a subgroup of infants the mean serum zinc concentration in the zinc group was 27% higher (p=0.004) than the placebo group.

NCT01727609,TRUE,NA,Speed of Increasing Milk Feeds Trial,"Survival of preterm infants has increased greatly over the years, so a major aim now is to improve the long term outlook for these babies and to avoid serious complications. The way babies are fed in early life affects short and long-term health and survival. Because the bowels of preterm infants have not matured, they cannot digest large volumes of milk feeds straight away. Until the gut matures, nutrition is provided by intravenous drip while the amount of milk given is gradually increased over time. Increasing the amount of milk rapidly may increase the risk of gut complications. Increasing the amount of milk given more slowly means that intravenous nutrition is needed for longer; there is an associated risk of infection proportional to the time the intravenous line is present in the bloodstream of these infants. Despite the importance of milk feeding preterm infants, there have been few studies to inform how best to balance these risks, and what the best way to increase feeds in these infants is - this study sets out to address this missing information.

The way babies are fed in early life affects short and long-term health and survival. Because the bowels of preterm infants have not matured, they cannot digest large volumes of milk feeds straight away. Until the gut matures, nutrition is provided by intravenous drip while the amount of milk given is gradually increased over time. Increasing the amount of milk rapidly may increase the risk of gut complications. Increasing the amount of milk given more slowly means that intravenous nutrition is needed for longer; there is an associated risk of infection proportional to the time the intravenous line is present in the bloodstream of these infants. Despite the importance of milk feeding preterm infants, there have been few studies to inform how best to balance these risks, and what the best way to increase feeds in these infants is - this study sets out to address this missing information.

NCT01651416,TRUE,NA,Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention Versus Home Management of Malaria in Children Under 5 Years in Ghana,"In areas of Africa where malaria is only a problem during a short rainy season, monthly courses of antimalarial drugs can provide very effective prevention of malaria in children. This approach, called intermittent preventive treatment in children (IPTc) but now known as Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC), may also be useful in large areas of Africa where malaria is transmitted for longer each year. It is uncertain if IPTc would be effective, acceptable to communities or sustainable when delivered over a longer period, but this is an important public health question of key interest to policy makers, because in areas with a longer transmission season, the burden of malaria is typically higher than in highly seasonal areas. Another form of prevention that would be operationally easier for African countries to put into practice would be to treat malaria patients with long-lasting antimalarials, which protect children against further malaria episodes for several weeks. Because malaria disproportionately affects certain high risk children more than others, causing repeated attacks of fever and leading to severe anaemia, long-acting drugs may be a simple and effective way to target limited resources at the individuals who most need protection. This may be particularly beneficial where malaria is a seasonal problem, because repeated malaria attacks will not only be borne by a few unfortunate children, but will also occur close together in time. The investigators propose a clinical trial to evaluate these two forms of chemoprevention in Kumasi, Ghana, an area with an extended malaria transmission season.

Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with antimalarial drugs given to all children once a month during the transmission season is a promising new strategy for malaria prevention. Studies in Senegal, Ghana, Mali and The Gambia have shown this approach can be highly effective. In Senegal, seasonal IPT with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and one dose of artesunate resulted in a 90% reduction in incidence of clinical malaria in a recent trial in Senegal (Cisse et al., Lancet 2006). The purpose of the present project is to determine the public health impact and cost effectiveness of this intervention when it is delivered through the routine health service to communities in rural areas in Senegal. Demographic surveillance will be set up in the rural population of three districts (Mbour, Bambey and Fatick) which comprises approximately 540,000 people, including 100,000 children under 5 yrs, and is served by 54 health posts, as an expansion of the area covered by the existing DSS of Niakhar.

Prior research has established that training approaches that do not include a period of intervention-specific supervision or consultation are ineffective and that implementation efforts that include only an initial period of supervision show an eventual attenuation of gains in knowledge and fidelity in practice.

Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) surveillance has demonstrated a major impact on PCV13 serotypes in infants < 2 years of age. The impact of the current change in PCV-program is hard to predict, but could eventually result in a re-emergence of serotypes not covered by PCV10 (i.e. 3, 6A and 19A). With this unique situation the foundation was laid for a carriage study during which the nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumonia (Sp) and other common colonizers of the nasopharynx will be studied in infants with acute otitis media (AOM) and in healthy infants attending day-care centers (DCC), two populations with high reported pneumococcal carriage. Young children are an important reservoir and major source of transmission of bacteria to the whole community and thus the preferred population to study nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage. Aim of the study The main aim of this study is to evaluate if changes in the conjugate anti-pneumococcal vaccination program in Belgium have an impact on the nasopharyngeal carriage of Pneumococcus in infants aged 6-30 months suffering from AOM or attending day-care, in order to guide future pneumococcal vaccine program decisions and vaccine development, and to feed AOM treatment guidelines in a PCV-program environment. The study will monitor overall pneumococcal carriage, the serotypes involved and the sensitivity of the isolated strains to antibiotics. In addition, the rhinopharyngeal carriage of other common nasopharyngeal colonizers associated with disease, in particular Haemophilus influenzae, will be studied in order to evaluate if changes in pneumococcal carriage impact on the carriage of those pathogens. In infants with AOM, the study will also monitor the clinical course of the AOM and a second nasopharyngeal sample will be taken in case of antibiotic treatment failure or AOM recurrence to identify any association with the carried pathogen.",Assessment of the Nasopharyngeal Carriage of Streptococcus Pneumoniae (Sp) and Other Common Pathogens in Infants (6-30 Months of Age) With Acute Otitis Media and in Healthy Infants (6-30 Months of Age) Attending Day-care Centers,Streptococcus Pneumoniae; Nasopharyngeal Carriage,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5000,NA,6 Months to 30 Months (Child),TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,"NA","NA","NA","NA",Wilrijk,"Heidi Theeten, Professor",Universiteit Antwerpen,NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5000,0,NA,NA,NA,Unknown status,Unknown status,Unknown status,NA,NA,Other,Nasopharyngeal sampling with a swab,"Rationale In Belgium, a unique situation exists for two reasons: on the one hand, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) program, which started in 2007, has quickly reached high coverage in infants: 3-dose coverage rose from 89 % in 2008 to 96.5 % in 2012 in Flanders and from 80.7 % in 2009 to 89.2 % in 2012 in Wallonia; and on the other hand, serotype coverage has moved from PCV7 (since 2007) to PCV13 (since 2011) and very recently to PCV10 (since July 2015 in Flanders and expected in May 2016 in the French Community).

However, childhood TB remains massively underreported and undiagnosed, mostly because of the challenges in confirming its diagnosis due to the paucibacillary nature of the disease and the difficulty in obtaining expectorated sputum in children. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years worldwide. There is growing evidence that, in high TB burden settings, TB is common in children with pneumonia, with up to 23% of those admitted to hospital with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia later being diagnosed as TB. However, the current WHO standard of care (SOC) for young children with pneumonia considers a diagnosis of TB only if the child has a history of prolonged symptoms or fails to respond to antibiotic treatments. Hence, TB is often under-diagnosed or diagnosed late in children presenting with pneumonia. In this context, the investigators are proposing to assess the impact on mortality of adding the systematic early detection of TB using Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, performed on NPAs and stool samples, to the WHO SOC for children with severe pneumonia, followed by immediate initiation of anti-TB treatment in children testing positive on any of the samples.

There is growing evidence that, in high TB burden settings, TB is common in children with pneumonia, with up to 23% of those admitted to hospital with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia later being diagnosed as TB. However, the current WHO standard of care (SOC) for young children with pneumonia considers a diagnosis of TB only if the child has a history of prolonged symptoms or fails to respond to antibiotic treatments. Hence, TB is often under-diagnosed or diagnosed late in children presenting with pneumonia. In this context, the investigators are proposing to assess the impact on mortality of adding the systematic early detection of TB using Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, performed on NPAs and stool samples, to the WHO SOC for children with severe pneumonia, followed by immediate initiation of anti-TB treatment in children testing positive on any of the samples. TB-Speed Pneumonia is a multicentric, stepped wedge diagnostic trial conducted in six countries with high TB incidence: Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Uganda, Mozambique, Zambia and Cambodia.",NA,NA,NA,NA,All-cause mortality 12 weeks after inclusion,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
NCT03143283,FALSE,NA,An ED-based RCT of Lethal Means Counseling for Parents of At-Risk Youth,"The National Action Alliance to Prevent Suicide recently released a research agenda aimed at significantly reducing suicide over the next decade. Aspirational Goal 12, ""Reduce access to lethal means that people use to attempt suicide,"" calls for identifying effective strategies to reduce a suicidal person's access to firearms and other lethal means. A promising strategy is to counsel patients seen in the emergency department (ED) for a psychiatric emergency to reduce access to firearms (the most lethal suicide method) and medications (the most common method of suicide attempt). To date, however, few studies have evaluated changes in firearm storage practices among those who received lethal means counseling (LMC), and those that have, including a pilot conducted in Colorado by the study team, have lacked control groups. Results from the pilot, which provided emergency department based LMC counseling to parents of suicidal adolescents, found that among gun-owning parents, 33% had unlocked guns at home on the day of the ED visit and none did on follow up. Using the piloted LMC protocol, we will conduct the first randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of ED-based LMC on firearm and medication storage. The proposed RCT, to be conducted in five Colorado hospitals, will test whether parents of at-risk adolescents who are treated in hospitals that have (vs. have not yet) implemented our LMC protocol are more likely to store household firearms and medications safely. In addition, we will conduct in-depth, qualitative interviews with parents who have received LMC counseling to better understand those factors that affect parents' willingness and ability to make changes to firearm and medication storage. We will also conduct qualitative interviews with clinicians to understand factors affecting clinician engagement in LMC.

Setting: The study will be conducted in 18 rural primary health center (PHC) in 9 districts in India near Lucknow, Nagpur, New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Trivandrum, Vellore, Chandigarh and Bhopal. Design: The unit of randomization will be the PHC. The recruited children will be followed up on days 4, 6 and 13-15 to assess primary and secondary outcome measures. Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that the clinical failure rate with use of either oral amoxycillin for three days or five days co-trimoxazole is similar. Intervention: Oral Co-trimoxazole (8mg/kg/day trimithoprim) twice a day for five days vs. oral amoxycillin (20 mg/kg/day) thrice a day for three days. Main objective: To compare the proportion of children aged 2 to 59 months presenting with non-severe pneumonia with or without wheeze, who do achieve clinical cure on day 6 on treatment with 5 days oral co-trimoxazole and 3 day oral amoxycillin, respectively. Main outcomes measures: Clinical cure on day 6; clinical failure between day 1-6; clinical relapse between day 7-15.

Efforts are ongoing to scale up interventions that work. These include the use of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN), Intermittent Preventive Treatment in children (IPTc), and test, treat and track (TTT). There is the need, however, for mass testing, treatment and tracking (MTTT) of the whole population to reduce the parasite load before implementing the aforementioned interventions. Though, Seasonal Malaria Chemoprophylaxis (SMC) is adopted for selected localities in Ghana, the impact of such interventions could be enhanced, if associated with MTTT in order to reduce the parasite load at baseline. MTTT of children in Ghana has demonstrated a parasite load reduction from 25% to 1%. However, unanswered questions include - could this be scaled up? What proportion of the community could be covered over a given time? What would it take to accomplish large scale MTTT? In designing interventions that aim at reducing the burden of malaria in children under five, for example, MTTT has largely been left out. Adults who are not often targeted by such interventions remain reservoirs that fuel transmission. This study explores the scale-up of interventions that work using existing community volunteer teams to lower cost. These volunteers will play a surveillance role by conducting home-based management of malaria. To avoid challenges posed by stockouts, short message service (SMS) will be used to monitor the level of stocks for malaria medicine and Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs). It is hypothesized that there are more asymptomatic malaria cases (those who carry the parasite but are not ill) than symptomatic cases reported by hospital records in the Pakro sub district and that, carrying out MTTT in combination with home-based management of malaria in specific communities could greatly reduce the burden.

During adolescence physical activity (PA) decreases and is likely an important contributor to the increasing trend in childhood obesity rates. Little evidence suggests that school-based curriculum interventions lead to increases in overall PA. Thus, this proposal will evaluate the efficacy of an innovative motivational and behavioral skills after-school program for promoting increases PA among underserved adolescents (e.g., minorities, low SES). The motivational plus behavioral skills intervention is consistent with Self-Determination (Motivation) Theory and Social Cognitive Theory in that it emphasizes increasing intrinsic motivation and behavioral skills for PA. Adolescents in the intervention take part in developing the program, selecting physical activities that generate fun and interest, and generating their own coping strategies for making effective PA changes during a videotaped session. Preliminary data from our group demonstrates the feasibility of the motivational plus behavioral skills PA program for increasing moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in underserved adolescents in South Carolina.

NCT03144739,FALSE,cluster RCT,Collaborative Care for Children's Mental Health Problems,"Background: Mental health problems cause a disproportionate burden of disability among children and youth compared to adults. Primary care plays an important role in efforts to prevent and intervene early in the course of child and adolescent mental health problems. While research with adults has shown the feasibility of integrating mental health care into primary care settings, there have been few studies among children and youth. Evidence remains lacking that integration is feasible in diverse settings, that it improves outcomes, and that methods can be developed to address the mixed symptoms of emerging child/youth problems and their overlap with developmental and parental disorders. Goals: The purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness of adding a child/youth mental health component into an existing collaborative care program for adult mental health problems. The work will refine a framework for efficient cultural adaption and tailoring of an existing child/youth primary care mental health intervention and then test whether the tailored intervention results in improved child and parent outcomes. The work will also provide evidence about the mechanisms by which those outcomes are achieved and what factors influence uptake of the child/youth component by general practitioners (GPs).

Overall, infections account for one-third of all neonatal deaths, with proportions approaching 50% in settings where neonatal mortality rates are high. Infections are predominately due to sepsis, respiratory infections, tetanus, and diarrhea. The investigators long term goal is to identify simple, affordable, and effective interventions that can be delivered at the community level in low-resource settings to reduce neonatal mortality risk due to these infections. The investigators team has conducted research in this area for the past 10 years, with specific focus on newborn vitamin A dosing and topical chlorhexidine antisepsis interventions.

Barrier function of the neonatal skin, however, is incomplete in newborn infants, especially those that are pre-term or of low birth weight.

The outcomes will be food waste, consumption, and pupils' satisfaction with the meals before and after introducing the new meal plan by interrupted time series analysis. Our hypothesis is that school meals can be optimized to be nutritious and more climate friendly, without negatively affecting acceptance, food waste and cost. A number of primary schools in one Swedish municipality with the same menu plan for all schools participated in the study. Their current meal supply was recorded in the form of a food list including amount and cost of each item over a 4-week period. This list was then optimized with linear programming to be as similar as possible to the baseline diet but with a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. No new foods were introduced and none were removed from the list. Nutritionally adequacy was ensured by included constraints into the model. The optimized food list was handed to a professional meal planner and a new menu plan was developed based on the revised food list. Data on food waste and consumption was collected daily during a baseline period of four weeks, and during the four-week intervention period. School lunch satisfaction was assessed twice with an online questionnaire at baseline and during the intervention. After the end of intervention, students and meal staff were interviewed regarding their experiences with the new meals.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

NCT01430247,FALSE,NA,Vision Screening for the Detection of Amblyopia,"INTRODUCTION. Amblyopia is defined as the loss of visual acuity (VA) in one or both eyes, without any obvious structural or pathological anomalies. Amblyopic eye should be able to regain some VA if treatment is initiated before the age of seven. It is the leading cause of monocular blindness in the 20- to 70-year olds with prevalence 2-5%. Amblyopia is mainly monocular, hence children are general asymptomatic. VA testing is the only reliable method of detecting amblyopia, and the fourth year of life is considered best for vision screening programs.

NCT00971958,FALSE,NA,"Infant Male Circumcision in Gaborone, Botswana, and Surrounding Areas: Feasibility, Safety and Acceptability","Background: Novel HIV prevention approaches are urgently needed in Botswana and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Although adult male circumcision (MC) has been shown to reduce the heterosexual acquisition of HIV by men by about 60%, MC in infancy is optimal for its relative ease, lower cost and low rate of complications. We have conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews that suggest neonatal MC (< 28 days of life) would be an acceptable public HIV prevention strategy in Botswana. The government of Botswana is committed to scaling up MC services in the immediate future and they plan to include neonates. Understanding decision-making around infant MC will be essential to maximize the effectiveness of this HIV prevention strategy. Specific Aims: The investigators propose to: 1) determine the acceptability and actual uptake of neonatal MC in southeastern Botswana and identify barriers to uptake; 2) ascertain the feasibility and safety of neonatal MC in Botswana; 3) Estimate what, if any, advantages would exist for scale up of Mogen Clamp, Plastibell or AccuCirc with regard to human resources, equipment needs, adverse events and acceptability to health-care providers and families in Botswana. Study Design and Schema: The investigators will conduct structured interviews with early postpartum mothers and fathers to determine correlates of neonatal MC acceptability and uptake, defined as neonatal MC following informed consent. Male infants will be circumcised by a trained doctor in a hospital / clinic setting by one of three FDA-approved devices that are currently in use in US hospitals: Mogen clamp, Plastibell or AccuCirc. Circumcision with Mogen Clamp or Plastibell will be done before 29 days of life. Circumcision with AccuCirc will be done before 11 days of life (FDA approval limit for device). The investigators will also administer questionnaires to the parents at the regular pediatric follow-up visit(s) to assess impressions of / satisfaction with the infant's procedure outcome over time. Provider impressions of the three methods will also be evaluated. Sample size will be 150 infants per arm for a total of 450 infants males circumcised (and an estimated 800 parental questionnaires). Public Health Significance: The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS state that countries with severe, generalized HIV epidemics but low rates of MC should offer this surgery as an important, evidence-based HIV prevention intervention, including among neonates. These two agencies also recommended that additional research on the most feasible, safe, and sustainable ways of scaling up MC intervention should be performed. This study will be in keeping with these recommendations. Please note the Mogen clamp and Plastibell study arms began as a randomized trial before the initiation of the AccuCirc single-arm portion. Although the settings in which the three devices were studied were similar, the AccuCirc trial enrollment began at two sites (Gaborone and Molepolole) only after completion of the Mogen clamp and Plastibell arms, which was conducted in three sites (Gaborone, Molepolole and Mochudi). Although Lobatse was a site for the first acceptability study with mothers, no procedures were performed there. Regarding the reported sample size: the total, final sample size includes both parents of newborn boys (because enrolled consenting parents completed questionnaires as part of this study), and boys whose parents consented to circumcision. We anticipated that not all parents who completed the questionnaire would consent to circumcising their baby; therefore, when planning the study it was necessary to estimate the number of parents who would participate in the survey (700), to achieve an enrollment of 300 neonates (therefore the initial estimate of 1000). The original study in fact enrolled 302 infants, 600 mothers and 19 fathers (total study population 921).

While many studies, mainly in Latin America and Asia, have investigated the impacts of CTs on poverty and food security and have, for the most part, found positive impacts, less is known about the impacts of CTs in Africa south of the Sahara, and, in particular, West Africa.

The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention designed to increase children's PA levels and improve the quality of lunches and snacks children consume in SDCs. The HEPA intervention is designed to target children, parents, staff, program leaders, and the SDC environment and uses a train-the-trainer model with SDC leaders to train their staff to deliver and integrate the intervention into routine practice. In the proposed study, the investigators will evaluate these HEPA strategies, using a 4-year randomized controlled trial with 20 SDCs.

Most of these deaths could have been avoided through cost-effective interventions. Ensuring that sick children receive adequate care in a country where 80% of the population lives in rural areas requires improved accessibility and high quality primary health care services. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses strategy (IMCI) was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in the 1990s and is an excellent way to improve the quality of country's child health services. However, in Burkina Faso IMCI suffers from a low level of adherence by health workers. According to a recent evaluation by the Ministry of Health (MoH), only 8.2% of children had benefited in 2012 from an consultation using IMCI guideline. Moreover, an analysis of children's records showed that only 15% of IMCI consultations were being correctly delivered and, for instance, only 34% of children with pneumonia who needed an antibiotic were prescribed the correct treatment. The obstacles to IMCI adoption in Burkina Faso are diverse and include inadequate training methods, shortage of material (papers, forms), lack of quality supervision by district executive teams, lack of integration between IMCI monitoring tools and the national health information system etc. The Integrated eDiagnosis Approach (IeDA) aims to address the poor quality of child health services in Burkina Faso by increasing the level of adherence to IMCI guidelines.
