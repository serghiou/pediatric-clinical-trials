Infections, including those affecting the umbilical cord (omphalitis) are a significant factor in approximately a third of these deaths. In fact, the odds of all-cause mortality are 46% higher among infants with umbilical cord infection than those without infection. Five large randomized controlled trials in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have examined the effect of multiple applications (for at least 7 days) of 4% chlorhexidine (CHX) on the umbilical cord on omphalitis and neonatal death. These studies show a consitent positive effect of multiple applications on omphalitis but not on neonatal mortality. Whereas there is mounting evidence for the effect of 7 day chlorhexidine application, there is no data from Africa and only one study from Asia that examines the effect of a single application of CHX as soon as possible after birth. In this single Asian study, CHX led to a reduction in the risk of mild-moderate omphalitis and neonatal death. It is important, in an African setting to explore the effect of a single application, which is programmatically much simpler to implement than daily application for 7 days. Therefore, the investigators' study will compare umbilical cord cleansing with a single application of 4% chlorhexidine at birth with dry cord care in both community and facility births on omphalitis and severe illness in the neonatal period. Methods: The chlorhexidine study is a community based, individually randomised controlled trial conducted on 4,760 mother-infant pairs in Uganda. The primary outcomes are severe illness and umbilical cord infection (omphalitis). Severe illness is defined as any illness associated with at least one of the following danger signs observed by study research assistants: inability to drink or breastfeed or (a history of) convulsions, lethargy or unconsciousness, vomiting of all feeds, and/or results in hospitalization and/or results in death. Discussion: This study will provide novel evidence, from a Sub-Saharan African setting of the effect of umbilical cord cleansing with a single application of 4% chlorhexidine at birth in both community and facility births.","Acceptability and Efficacy of Umbilical Cord Cleansing With 4% Chlorhexidine for the Prevention of Newborn Infections in Lira District, Northern Uganda: A Randomised Controlled Trial",Omphalitis; Septicaemia,y,y,less_developed,n,n,Centre For International Health,"Globvac, Research Council of Norway through a young investigator grant (grant number: 234500 ) as well as its Centres of Excellence scheme and the University of Bergen (UiB), Norway to the Centre for Intervention Science in Maternal and Child Health (CISMAC; project reference number: 223269).",public,NA,NA,0,2017-07-12T00:00:00Z,1,4760,NA,NA,Biological,Intervention arm: 4% chlorhexidine,topical_solution,Prevention,Proportion of infants with severe illness; Proportion of infants with omphalitis,Death; Adverse events,2016-07-01T00:00:00Z,2015-11-12T00:00:00Z,44166,2020-03-25T00:00:00Z

Current treatment of acute watery diarrhoea includes oral rehydration solution (ORS), zinc and continued feeding. The use of zinc is based on a number of studies that showed that zinc reduces the duration and severity of diarrhoea. The recommended dose of zinc in 6-59 month old children is 20mg/day for 10-14 days. This dose is associated with an increased risk of vomiting. No dosing studies are available to determine the optimal dose of zinc, which while maintaining the benefits also has a low risk of vomiting. The investigators will conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial of three doses of zinc (20mg/day, 10mg/day and 5mg/day) in two settings - one in Sub-Saharan Africa and the other in South Asia. The study population will be 4500 children with diarrhoea of less than 72 hours duration who are aged 6-59 months. They will be recruited from outpatient health facilities. All enrolled children will receive ORS and continued feeding as recommended by the World Health Organization. Those allocated to the standard zinc dose will receive an oral dispersible tablet with 20mg zinc daily for 14 days. Those allocated to lower dose zinc will receive identical tablets with either 10mg or 5mg zinc daily for 14 days.

Although the mortality burden of diarrhoea has substantially reduced, the morbidity pattern remained almost unchanged. Recent randomized controlled supplementation trials in developing countries have consistently shown that zinc has the potential to reduce the duration of diarrhoea as well as has preventive effect on childhood diarhroea in subsequent months. Currently, international health agencies recommend zinc as an important adjunct therapy to treat diarrhoea in developing countries where zinc deficiency is highly prevalent and diet is poor in zinc. The recommendation is to provide 20 mg elemental zinc daily for 10 days during each episode of diarrhoea. This study aims at evaluating the relative efficacy of two length of 20 mg zinc therapy (5 vs 10 days) during acute diarrhoea in a rural community in a community-based individually randomized placebo-controlled trial with 20 mg zinc daily and will be conducted in seven villages in the ICDDR,B Matlab study area. The study will require 2050 acute dirrhoeal episodes to be treated who will be randomly allocated to one of the two treatment schedules (20 mg of zinc daily for 5 or 10 days). Children who will be allocated to the shorter duration therapy will receive placebo for the remaining days to complete 10-day treatment. Female Field Workers (FFWs) will conduct diarrhoea surveillance and administer zinc daily at home. Data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical procedure. Findings of this study will be immensely valuable for deciding recommendation for the duration of zinc therapy in the management of acute diarrhoea in young children and will have profound programmatic and policy implications for scaling up zinc intervention in the community.",Efficacy of Short Course Zinc Therapy (5 vs 10 d) With 20 mg Elemental Zinc Daily in the Treatment of Acute Diarrhoea: A Double-blind Individually Randomized Controlled Community Trial.,Acute Watery Diarrhoea,y,y,less_developed,n,n,0,bill and melinda,foundation,"Alam DS, Yunus M, El Arifeen S, et al.

The current view of the medical and public health community in India is that the immediate focus should be on promoting survival and development of low birth weight infants who have nearly a 6 to 7 fold higher mortality during infancy than those with normal birth weight. Low serum zinc is associated with increased incidence of diarrhea and pneumonia. There is sufficient evidence in under-threes that during acute illness, zinc supplementation (1-2 recommended dietary allowance [RDA]) reduces incidence of all episodes of diarrhea, severe diarrhea and pneumonia. A number of initial published trials also show significant effect of zinc treatment on pneumonia. With the large and consistent effects of zinc supplementation on the incidence and severity of infections, an effect on child mortality is likely. Available literature suggests the distinct possibility of reduced neonatal and infant mortality in LBWs receiving 1 RDA of zinc daily. A pilot study in India showed a 54% reduction in mortality in LBW infants. These findings were based on a very small sample and therefore considered insufficient to change policy. A positive impact in the proposed study will provide an important tool for reduction of infant mortality which is currently stagnant and government acceptance for such a program is likely to be very high. We, the researchers at the Society for Applied Studies, believe this study has the potential for decreasing infant mortality from its current level.","Impact of Zinc Supplementation in Low Birth Weight Infants on Severe Morbidity, Mortality and Zinc Status: A Randomized Controlled Trial",Diarrhea; Respiratory Infection; Low Birth Weight,y,y,less_developed,n,n,"World Health Organization; Linda and Kenneth Pollin Foundation, Inc.",Kenneth and Linda Pollin Foundation; New York Presbyterian Hospital; Columbia University; Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development; World Health Organization,public; foundation,"Taneja S, Bhandari N, Rongsen-Chandola T, Mahalanabis D, Fontaine O, Bhan MK.

The VITALITY Trial,"There is an urgent need to prevent the onset and progression of food allergy in our population. Evidence demonstrates that food allergy and atopic eczema represent the earliest manifestations of the atopic march with 50% of infants with food allergy predicted to develop respiratory allergic diseases later in life. We report that Australia has the highest prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the world, with 10% of infants having challenge-proven food allergy in Melbourne. There has been a 5-fold increase in hospital admissions for life-threatening anaphylaxis. These changes are most pronounced in children less than 5 years, suggesting a causal role for early life determinants. We have primary data to inform hypotheses for the rise in food allergy, which appears to result from potentially modifiable factors related to the modern lifestyle, particularly Vitamin D insufficiency (VDI), and have demonstrated an association between VDI and increased risk of challenge-proven food allergy in 12-month old infants, which supports numerous ecological studies showing an increased risk of food allergy the further a child resides from the equator (associated with decreased UV exposure and Vitamin D levels). Despite Australia's sunny climate, population rates of VDI have steadily increased in infants and pregnant women in parallel to the apparent rise in food allergic disease. This association is biologically plausible, as there is evidence Vitamin D is critical to the healthy development of the immune system in early life. We propose an intervention study to assess if infant Vitamin D supplementation during the first year of life significantly decreases the risk of early-onset food allergy. Australia is ideally placed to answer this important question since, unlike the USA, Canada and Europe, there are no population recommendations for routine infant supplementation with Vitamin D and we are one of the few developed countries that do not supplement the food chain supply with Vitamin D.",Can Vitamin D Supplementation in Infants Prevent Food Allergy in the First Year of Life?

Friendly bacteria called ""Probiotics"" have been used in multiple infectious and inflammatory disease states in humans. Fructooligosaccharides are sugars found naturally in many fruits and vegetables and also in human breast milk. These sugars reach the colon undigested and serve as food for the friendly bacteria.

This tube is called a central venous catheter. Occasionally these catheters can cause infections in the blood and sometimes the tubes can get blocked by small blood clots. Some intensive care units already use antibiotic or heparin coated catheters, but there is no proof that these are better than the standard ones at preventing infections. Most of the PICU's in this country use standard lines. The only way to find out for certain is to compare children who are given antibiotic or heparin coated catheters with those who are given standard ones in a clinical trial. Because we do not know which type of catheter is best, the type of catheter each child receives in the study will be decided randomly by chance. Each child in the trial will have the same chance of getting any of these three catheters: - Standard central venous catheter (not coated). - Heparin coated central venous catheter. Heparin is a medicine that can stop blood from clotting and might stop the tubes being blocked and infections in the blood. - Antibiotic coated central venous catheter. Antibiotics can be used to kill bacteria which cause the infections. The aim of this study is to see how the three types of catheters compare in reducing the amount of blood infections in children.

Doctors try to remove the tube in the wind-pipe that links the baby to the breathing machine as soon as possible. However, small babies get tired, and still require help to breathe. One of the standard and common techniques to help them breathe without a tube in the wind-pipe is to use simple pressure support, nasal continuous positive airway pressure or nCPAP. This supports breathing a little, but it is often not enough to prevent the need to go back on the breathing machine. Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is similar to nCPAP, but also gives some breaths, or extra support, to babies through a small tube in the nose.

Many studies have shown that hospital readmission rates have increased with this practice, and jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia is the most common cause of readmission of newborns. Peak serum bilirubin levels usually occur on postnatal days 3-5, by when many have already been discharged putting the infant at increased risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia. Severe neonatal jaundice still constitutes an important cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in Africa. Screening all newborns for the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia before hospital could help in early identification of hyperbilirubinemia and early intervention and potentially prevent unwanted consequences like bilirubin induced neurological dysfunction. However, there are conflicting recommendations on the use of universal transcutaneous bilirubin screening for jaundice in all newborns before hospital discharge.",Transcutaneous Screening for Risk of Severe Hyperbilirubinemia in South African Newborns,Neonatal Jaundice; Hyperbilirubinemia,n,n,less_developed,y,y,Stanford University,NA,notavailable,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1858,1858,NA,Device; Other,Transcutaneous bilirubin screening; Standard care (Visual inspection),medical_device,Screening,Readmission for hyperbilirubinemia,Phototherapy before discharge; TsB > 427 umol/l or TsB > threshold for exchange transfusion; Length of hospital stay (days); Blood draw for total serum bilirubin,2015-08-01T00:00:00Z,2015-11-17T00:00:00Z,42644,1899-12-31T00:00:00Z

Any effort should be done to minimize the time under invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).Nonetheless, clinical trials have shown that a relevant proportion of preterm neonates fails this approach and eventually need IMV.The duration of IMV is a well known risk factor for the development of broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD) - a condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. To minimize the duration of IMV, various non invasive respiratory support modalities are available in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). CPAP is presently the most common technique used in this regard. However, a systematic review has shown that non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) reduces the need for IMV (within one week from extubation) more effectively than NCPAP, although it is not clear if NIPPV may reduce need for intubation longterm and it seems to have no effect on BPD and mortality. NIPPV main drawback is the lack of synchronization, which is difficult to be accurately achieved and is usually unavailable. A more recent alternative technique is non-invasive high frequency oscillatory ventilation (NHFOV) which consists on the application of a bias flow generating a continuous distending positive pressure with oscillations superimposed on spontaneous tidal breathing with no need for synchronization. The physiological, biological and clinical details about NHFOV have been described elsewhere. To date, there is only one small observational uncontrolled study about the use of NHFOV after extubation in preterm infants. Other relatively small case series or retrospective cohort studies suggested safety, feasibility and possible usefulness of NHFOV and have been reviewed elsewhere.The only randomized trial published so far compared NHFOV to biphasic CPAP,in babies failing CPAP and it has been criticized for methodological flaws and for not taking into account respiratory physiology.An European survey showed that, despite the absence of large randomized clinical trials, NHFOV is quite widely used, at least in some Countries and no major side effects are reported, although large data about NHFOV safety are lacking. This may be due to the relative NHFOV easiness of use but evidence-based and physiology-driven data are warranted about this technique.",Nasal High Frequency Oscillation Ventilation(NHFOV) vs. Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure(NCPAP) vs Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation（NIPPV） as Post-extubation Respiratory Support in Preterm Infants With Respiratory Distress Syndrome:a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,Intubated Infants Were Intend to Extubation Using Noninvasive Ventilation Strategies,n,n,less_developed,n,y,"Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Jiulongpo No.1 People's Hospital; Chongqing Maternal and Child Health Hospital; The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University; Children’s Hospital of The Capital Institute of Pediatrics; Peking University Third Hospital; First Hospital of Tsinghua University; Women and Children's Hospital, Branch of Chongqing Sanxia Central Hospital; First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University; Quanzhou Children's Hospital; Xiamen Maternity & Child Care Hospital; Zhujiang Hospital; Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University; Guangdong Academy of Medical Science and General Hospital; Guangdong Women and Children Hospital; Women and Children’s Health Hospital of Yulin; Women and Children Health Care Hospitalof GuangXi Zhuang Autonomous; Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University; Guiyang Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital; Zunyi First People's Hospital; Second Hospital of Lanzhou University; Gansu Provincial Maternity and Child-Care Hospital; LanZhou University; First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University; First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University; Zhengzhou Children's Hospital, China; Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University; the Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Hainan Province; Bethune International Peace Hospital; Wuhan Union Hospital, China; Children’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University; First Hospital of Jilin University; Children's Hospital of Fudan University; Maternal and Children’s Healthcare Hospital of Taian; The Second Hospital of Shandong University; Shanxi Provincial Maternity and Children's Hospital; Chengdu Women and Children's Center Hospital; The Affiliated Hospital Of Southwest Medical University; Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University; Shenzhen People’s Hospital, The Second Medical College of Jinan University; Tianjin Central Hospital of Gynecology Obstetrics; People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; Kunming Children's Hospital; The First People's Hospital of Yunnan; The First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical College; Yan’an Hospital Affiliated to Kunming Medical University; Women and Children’s Health Hospital of Qujing; The People's Hospital of Dehong Autonomous Prefecture; Yinchuan No 1 people’s Hospital Affiliated of Ningxia Medical University; The Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine; Women's Hospital School Of Medicine Zhejiang University; Beijing 302 Hospital; Hunan Children's Hospital; Women and Children Hospital of Qinghai Province; Jiangxi Province Children's Hospital; Inner Mongolia People's Hospital; Mianyang Central Hospital; People's Liberation Army No.202 Hospital; Ningbo Women & Children's Hospital; Shanghai Children's Medical Center; First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University; Nanjing Medical University; Qinhuangdao Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital; Xuzhou Children Hospital; South Paris University Hospitals, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Xianyang children’s Hospital",Chongqing Medical Research Unit,industry,NA,NA,0,2019-07-26T00:00:00Z,1,1440,NA,NA,Device; Device; Device,NHFOV; NCPAP; NIPPV,medical_device,Treatment,duration of invasive mechanical ventilation; ventilator-free days; the number of reintubation,airleaks; bronchopulmonary dysplasia(BPD); Retinopathy of prematurity> 2nd stage; Neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis≥ 2nd stage; Intraventricular hemorrhage>2nd grade; need for postnatal steroids; in-hospital mortality; composite mortality/BPD; Weekly weight gain; haemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),2018-01-01T00:00:00Z,2017-05-28T00:00:00Z,44196,2019-07-22T00:00:00Z

For some, however, the arch does not fully form or it might be flat against the ground. When this happens, it is known as having flat feet which can cause pain in the feet, legs, or back. At the moment, we are not sure what the best treatment for flat feet is, so the purpose of this research is to conduct a trial to compare three of the most common treatments that are used today. Two of the treatments are different types of insoles, which are put inside the shoe. The third treatment is some exercises and advice about which types of shoes might help. Participants will receive their treatment as part of their normal National Health System care. We would like 1055 children and young people aged between six and 16 years old to take part in the study. Everyone will receive advice about the type of shoes to wear, ankle exercises and things to look out for when children have painful flat feet. In addition to this, 422 of the participants will receive an insole that is individually customised for them, whilst another 422 will receive a pre-made insole that is the right size. We will ask for their help for 12 months. During this time, we will track their progress by sending them three questionnaires in the post to fill in and weekly text messages to find out how painful their feet are during the first few months. We also want to learn more about the problems that flat feet cause, and children's experiences of the treatments delivered as part of this clinical trial. We will explore this through in-depth conversations with children and their parent(s) or the person who looks after them. Once we have finished the trial, we will work with the people who took part in the trial, and clinicians, to make sure that our results can be used by as many people as possible. In addition to the main OSTRICH study we will run three additional studies. The first will find out if including a pen and having information about the study in the form of a video in addition to information in a paper booklet will increase the number of participants who take part in the study.

The main reasons are limited clinical skills and time, unavailability of diagnostic tests (laboratory or x-ray) and non-adherence to practice guidelines. Child mortality is therefore higher than it should be. Etiological diagnostic tests (detecting microorganisms) may not always help since the distinction between infection and disease and between mild or severe disease is not straightforward. Overprescription of antibiotics is therefore widespread and leads to the development of drug resistance. To address these challenges, decision charts for the management of febrile illness will be developed and include i) few clinical parameters simple to assess, and ii) POCTs results based on specific host markers that can discriminate between mild and severe disease, pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections, and unspecific fevers of bacterial and of viral origin. This algorithm combining clinical and bedside laboratory tests will be built on an electronic support (android tablet). The first objective of the study is to assess the safety of new electronic decision trees that integrate simple clinical assessment and POCTs results (oxygen saturation and a combination of specific biomarkers of inflammation) as a triage tool to decide on admitting febrile children; the second objective is to assess the usefulness and safety of new electronic decision trees that integrate simple clinical assessment and POCT results (a combination of specific biomarkers of inflammation) as decision-making tool to prescribe antibiotics to non-severe febrile children. The development of such a tool will decrease mortality due to delayed admission, At the same time, it will decrease irrational use of antibiotics, and hence drug pressure and emergence of drug resistance, which represents one of the most important public health threat our world is facing today.

Deterioration of the clinical condition of hospitalised patients is often preceded by physiological changes up to 24 hours before death.

The purpose of this study is to investigate if Paediatric early Warning Score (PEWS) optimises identification of acute and critically ill children and prevents life-threatening situations. The hypothesis is that implementation of PEWS supported by directions for action algorithms for intervention will have an impact on number of unplanned transfers to intensive care in already hospitalised children. This study is a multi-centre randomised controlled intervention study designed within a Complex Intervention framework; the study sheds light on the problem, validation of the data collection instrument, testing of the intervention and evaluation. The study involves all paediatric departments and some acute departments in Central Denmark Region. The study is designed as a randomised controlled intervention study where children are randomised to one of two different Paediatric Early Waning Score models. Development and implementation of PEWS is expected to contribute to reduce the number of children developing acute critical illness, number of admissions to intensive care. PEWS is also expected to contribute to increase professional skills and competences in health professionals. It is expected that this study will contribute towards working with a joint PEWS model in Denmark.

The way babies are fed in early life affects short and long-term health and survival. Because the bowels of preterm infants have not matured, they cannot digest large volumes of milk feeds straight away. Until the gut matures, nutrition is provided by intravenous drip while the amount of milk given is gradually increased over time. Increasing the amount of milk rapidly may increase the risk of gut complications. Increasing the amount of milk given more slowly means that intravenous nutrition is needed for longer; there is an associated risk of infection proportional to the time the intravenous line is present in the bloodstream of these infants. Despite the importance of milk feeding preterm infants, there have been few studies to inform how best to balance these risks, and what the best way to increase feeds in these infants is - this study sets out to address this missing information. The study will compare two different speeds of milk feed increase, one 'faster' and one 'slower', both within rates currently used in United Kingdom neonatal units. The study aims to find out if either speed of milk feed increase gives better outcomes for the infants.

It is generally acknowledged that breastfeeding is one of the main pillars in allergy prevention. Infant formulas based on hydrolysed proteins have been developed to be used by infants at increased risk of developing allergy in case a mother is unable or chooses not to breastfeed her infant. The effect of hydrolysed formula in allergy prevention has been examined in many studies, from which it can be concluded that currently there is not sufficient evidence to support hydrolysed protein over intact protein for allergy risk reduction. Moreover, several clinical trials support the suggestion of supplementation of pre and/or probiotics for the reduction of eczema development, recognized by international authorities. The present study (MAESTRO) investigates the preventive effect of a hypoallergenic concept combining several nutritional approaches related to preventive strategies: partially hydrolysed protein formula supplemented with prebiotics and probiotics. The aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy, growth and safety of this concept compared to standard (intact protein) infant formula on the development of allergic manifestations up to the age of 12 months in infants at increased risk of developing allergy.","A Randomised, Double-blind, Controlled, Parallel-group, Multi-country Study to Investigate the Effect of a Partially Hydrolysed Infant Formula With Added Synbiotics on the Development of Allergic Manifestations in Infants at High Risk of Developing Allergy",Immunity,n,n,notreported,unavailable,unavailable,0,Nutricia Research,industry,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,1700,NA,NA,Other; Other,Infant Formula with added synbiotics; Standard Infant formula,infant_ formula,Prevention,Allergic manifestations (IgE-mediated),Allergic manifestations (IgE-mediated and non IgE-mediated),2021-06-01T00:00:00Z,2017-02-01T00:00:00Z,45078,2019-05-03T00:00:00Z

The study will recruit 1500 mother-infant pairs in 4 African countries. Study design: PROMISE PEP is a multinational, randomised double-blind controlled clinical trial. Intervention: Infants will be randomised to receive LPV/r or 3TC twice daily from day seven (± 2 days) after birth until 4 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding (BF). We will recommend exclusive BF (EBF) up till including the 26th week of life followed by a relatively rapid (maximum of 8 weeks) cessation period. The maximum duration of PEP will thereby be 38 weeks. Primary objective: To compare the efficacy of infant LPV/r (40/10mg twice daily if 2-4kg and 80/20mg twice daily if >4kg) vs. Lamivudine 7,5mg twice daily if 2-4kg, 25mg twice daily if 4-8kg and 50mg twice daily if >8kg) from day 7 until 4 weeks after cessation of BF (maximum duration of prophylaxis: 50 weeks for a maximum duration of breastfeeding of 46 weeks) to prevent postnatal HIV-1 acquisition between 7 days and 50 weeks of age. Secondary objectives: - To assess the safety of long-term infant prophylaxis with LPV/r versus Lamivudine (including resistance, adverse events and growth) until 50 weeks. - HIV-1-free survival until 50 weeks - To build clinical trials capacity at the four study sites. Main endpoint: Acquisition of HIV-1 (as assessed by HIV-1 DNA PCR) between day 7 and 50 weeks of age Study population: HIV-uninfected infants at day 7 (± 2 days) born to HIV-1 infected mothers not eligible for HAART who choose to breastfeed their infants and who have benefited from the national prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) program during pregnancy and delivery. The study will recruit 1500 mother-infant pairs in Burkina Faso, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia. Study duration: Infants will be followed up for 50 weeks and the total study duration is five years. Expected outcome: This study will inform on the relative advantages (efficacy) and drawbacks of two interventions to support HIV-1-infected women not eligible for HAART to safely breastfeed their babies.

Our goal is to determine whether the avoidance of methylxanthine drugs will improve survival without disability to 18 months, corrected for prematurity. Methylxanthine drugs such as caffeine are used to prevent or treat periodic breathing and breath-holding spells in premature infants. However, there is a striking lack of evidence for the long-term efficacy and safety of this therapy. Methylxanthines block a naturally occurring substance, called adenosine, which protects the brain during episodes of oxygen deficiency. Such episodes are common in infants who are treated with methylxanthines. It is possible that methylxanthines may worsen the damage caused by lack of oxygen.

Mass azithromycin distribution to children aged 1-59 months has been shown to reduce childhood mortality in Niger, Tanzania, and Malawi. This study did not evaluate the effect of azithromycin administered during the neonatal period. Observational evidence from high income countries has suggested that macrolides, including erythromycin and azithromycin, may be associated with increased risk of development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). However, these studies are limited by confounding by indication, as infants only receive antibiotics when they are ill. The investigators proposed an individually randomized trial of azithromycin versus placebo to establish the efficacy and safety of administration of a dose of azithromycin during the neonatal period. The long-term goal is generate evidence that can be used by neonatal and child survival programs related to the use of azithromycin in the youngest children who have the highest risk of mortality. The investigators hypothesize that a single dose of azithromycin administered in the neonatal period will lead to significantly reduced risk of mortality and that this dose will be safe.

In endemic areas, malaria accounts for around 50% of the mortality, 13-50% of all school absenteeism, and causes anaemia in approximately 85 million school-aged children of sub Saharan Africa that also impairs the cognitive development of children. Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of pregnant women as well as seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children under the age of five have been implemented in several sub-Saharan countries and have proven to be very effective. However, none of these IPT strategies is targeting school children. A clinical trial is being conducted to expand the IPT by testing effectiveness and safety of two antimalarial drugs Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) in preventing malaria related morbidity in school aged children (IPTsc) living in high endemic areas. Methods: A randomized, open label, controlled trial will enrol 1602 school children aged 5-15 years, who will receive either DP or ASAQ or control (no drug ), using a ""balanced block design"" with the ""standard of care"" arm as reference. The interventional treatments are given every 4 months 3 rounds for the first year. A second non-interventional year will assess possible rebound effects. All study-arms receive bed nets, early diagnosis and care for malaria, and praziquantel and albendazole as mass treatment for helminthiasis. The primary endpoint are change from baseline in mean haemoglobin concentration at months 12 and 20 of follow-up and clinical malaria incidence from month 0 till months 12 and 20 of follow up. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Mixed design methods will be used to assess the acceptability, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of this IPTsc as part of a more comprehensive school children health package. Discussion: The national school health programme (NSHP), Tanzania, combines schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminthes (STH) control package under national schistosomiasis and STH control programme (NSSCP). Malaria intervention using IPTsc strategy may be integrated in NSHP with the same platform as NSSCP, however, there is limited systematic evidence to assess the operational feasibility of this approach. School aged children are a reachable target population in any endemic malaria setting. The suggested strategy will provide effective protection against malaria, hasten either the elimination process and/or diminish the reservoir and burden.",Effectiveness and Safety of Intermittent Preventive Treatment for Malaria Using Either Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or Artesunate-amodiaquine in Reducing Malaria Related Morbidities and Improving Cognitive Ability in School-aged Children in Tanzania: A Controlled Randomised Trial,"Malaria,Falciparum; Anemia",n,n,less_developed,y,y,Universiteit Antwerpen,Flemish Inter-university Council,public,"Makenga G, Baraka V, Francis F, et al.

The objective is to conduct a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for 6 months among HIV-uninfected children with severe malnutrition following stabilization. The primary outcome will be survival at one year. Secondary outcomes are toxicity, growth, the frequency and causes of hospitalisation and microbial resistance to antibiotics. Cotrimoxazole has striking protective efficacy against mortality among children with HIV, despite not altering the underlying immune deficiency. It is hypothesised that co-trimoxazole prophylaxis will have a similar effect in children immunocompromised because of severe malnutrition. Worldwide, severe malnutrition is commoner than HIV in childhood and co-trimoxazole is cheap and widely available, making it easily translatable to policy.","Randomized, Placebo Controlled Trial of Cotrimoxazole Prophylaxis Amongst HIV-uninfected Children With Severe Malnutrition",Nutrition Disorders; Life-threatening Infection,y,n,less_developed,y,y,Kenya Medical Research Institute,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,foundation,"Berkley JA, Ngari M, Thitiri J, et al.

Efficient, comprehensive and validated methods for monitoring drug resistance in advance of the development of resistance to the antimalarial drugs that are in use are urgently needed. Molecular markers of genetic polymorphisms that give rise to resistant P. falciparum parasites and methods in population genetics for evaluating the data can be valuable tools for monitoring drug resistance in the field. This study aims to: 1. Prospectively measure the in vivo response of P. falciparum malaria in Mali to several different antimalarial drugs and drug combinations: chloroquine (CQ), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), amodiaquine (AQ), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in combination with amodiaquine (SP/AQ), amodiaquine in combination with artesunate (AQ/AS), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in combination with artesunate (SP/AS), and artemether-lumefantrine (Co-artem). In one site with preliminary data showing a high rate of P. falciparum resistance to mefloquine (MQ), this drug will also be tested. 2. Measure the frequencies of molecular markers for antimalarial drug resistance, and examine how those results relate to the efficacy of these drugs in treating clinical malaria 3. Measure drug levels at 3 days and correlate with efficacy results. 4. Examine early clinical, parasitologic, and clinical predictors of late treatment failure. 5.

Artemether-lumefantrine is the only available fixed-dose Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy actually available and is considered as the gold standard for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria. This study will therefore aim to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the combination of CDA to artemether-lumefantrine in terms of efficacy at 28-days. The key secondary objectives will compare the Parasite Clearance Times (PCT) and the Fever Clearance Times (FCT) between CDA and artemether-lumefantrine.","A Multi-centre, Randomised, Double-blind, Double Dummy Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate Versus Artemether-lumefantrine in the Treatment of Acute Uncomplicated Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria in Children and Adolescents in Africa.","Malaria, Falciparum",n,n,less_developed,n,n,0,GlaxoSmithKline,industry,"Premji Z, Umeh RE, Owusu-Agyei S, et al.

The leukemia cells present themselves with quite differently activated regulatory mechanisms of the malignant phenotype. The introduction of more accurate methods of assessing therapy response (""minimal residual disease [MRD] tests"") has provided new insights into very different mechanisms of action, including factors influenced by host factors; this has had practical clinical consequences for the use of more individualized therapy. Multimodal therapies have enabled a cure level of over 80% for ALL in this age group. However, the own and international study data show that the therapy toxicity of the contemporary chemotherapy concepts has become unacceptably high, in particular with respect to those intensified therapies used for the treatment of patients at high risk of ALL relapse. The AIEOP-BFM ALL 2017 study therefore aims for an innovative integrated approach that will not only adapt the risk stratification to new prognostic markers using more comprehensive diagnostics, but above all, qualitatively reorient the therapy. The most important consequence will be that this study is testing immunotherapy with the bispecific antibody blinatumomab as an alternative to particularly intensive and toxic chemotherapy elements in precursor B-cell ALL (pB-ALL) patients with detectable chemotherapy resistance and at high risk of relapse. With the aim to complement the effects of the conventional chemotherapy, Blinatumomab is in addition tested in the large group of pB-ALL patients at intermediate relapse risk with seemingly unremarkable leukemia, but who account for a large proportion of all relapses. Targeted therapy is also used in the form of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib for patients with pB-ALL and slow response to the drugs of the induction chemotherapy with the aim to overcome intrinsic chemotherapy resistance of the ALL cells. In patients with T-lineage ALL, who have particularly poor chances for cure after relapse, the established consolidation chemotherapy has proved to be particularly effective. This chemotherapy phase is therefore tested in a longer and more intensive form in such T-ALL patients with intermediate or slow early treatment response with the aim to reduce the relapses rate in this subgroup.",International Collaborative Treatment Protocol for Children and Adolescents With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - AIEOP-BFM ALL 2017,"Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Pediatric",n,n,highly_developed,n,n,"Deutsche Krebshilfe e.V., Bonn (Germany)",NA,notavailable,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,5000,NA,NA,Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug,Blinatumomab; Bortezomib; Cyclophosphamide; Cytarabine; Daunorubicin; DAUNOrubicin Liposomal Injection [DaunoXome]; Dexamethasone; Doxorubicin; Etoposide; Fludarabine Phosphate; Ifosfamide; 6-Mercaptopurine; Methotrexate; Pegaspargase; Prednisolone; Tioguanin; Vincristine; Vindesine; Erwinase,drug,Treatment,Event-free survival; Disease-free survival,Survival; Treatment-related mortality; Adverse Events of interest/Serious Adverse Events; MRD response; Proportion of patients with Blina Poor-Response,2018-07-15T00:00:00Z,2018-07-12T00:00:00Z,46948,2020-01-02T00:00:00Z

The effect of IPT in children in the prevention of malaria has been evaluated in a number of trials in areas of seasonal malaria transmission. Results from these trials have shown that IPTc provided between 40% - 86% protection against clinical malaria. In 2006, a trial that compared two methods of IPTc delivery was carried out in Upper River Division, The Gambia. Preliminary results of the trial have shown that the treatment was very effective as only 4% (45/1133) of the children seen at the end of year cross-sectional survey were parasitaemic. Tolerability was assessed in a subset of 1100 children and the results showed that about 13.5% of children developed mild to moderate vomiting. Malaise was present in about 10% of the study subjects. Severe adverse events were rare. Thus it is important to investigate if other drug regimens might be equally effective in preventing malaria but less likely to cause adverse events. During the 2007 malaria transmission season, 1009 children aged 1-5 years will be individually randomized to receive amodiaquine plus SP, piperaquine plus SP or Artekin TM (dihdroartemisinin plus piperaquine) at monthly intervals on three occasions during the months of September, October, and November. To determine the prevalence of side effects following drug administration participants in each treatment group will be visited at home three and seven days after each round of drug administration and a side effects questionnaire completed. To help establish whether these adverse events are drug related, the same questionnaire will be administered after each treatment round, to 286 age-matched children who are not part of the trial. The primary ends points will be the incidence of adverse events.","Comparison of Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Three Drug Combinations for Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Children Aged 1-5 Years in an Area of Seasonal Malaria Transmission in Upper River Division, The Gambia",Malaria,n,n,less_developed,n,n,"Department of State for Health and Social Welfare, The Gambia",Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,foundation,"Bojang K, Akor F, Bittaye O, et al.

The primary purpose of the algorithm is to prevent mortality due to bacterial pneumonia. However, an unknown proportion of children managed in this fashion will have a viral related wheezing illness or asthma rather than pneumonia. Although it is unlikely that wheezing syndromes are a significant cause of mortality for children in developing countries, these algorithms are likely to result in unnecessary administration of antibiotics as well as inadequate treatment of recurrent wheezing illness. We do not have clear evidence about whether antibiotics can be withheld in some categories of children with wheeze. It is clear that wheeze can occur in bacterial infection and in addition co-infection with virus and bacteria has been well demonstrated in several studies of pneumonia etiology in children. Although some studies have found that children with more severe disease or who are blood culture positive are more likely to be febrile at presentation, this sign is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to determine whether antibiotics should be administeredSetting: The study will be conducted in eight medical colleges situated in Lucknow, Nagpur, New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Trivandrum, Vellore, and Chandigarh. Design: This will be a multicentric, randomized, double blind efficacy trial. . Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that the use of oral amoxycillin for three days would be as effective, in terms of clinical cure on day 4 as compared to use of oral placeboMain objective: To compare the proportion of children aged 2 to 59 months presenting with non-severe pneumonia with wheeze whose respiratory rate does not fall below the age specific cut-off after three doses of nebulized salbutamol, that achieve clinical cure on day 4 on 3 day of treatment with oral amoxycillin versus placebo.Inclusion criteria: Children aged 2-59 months with non-severe pneumonia based on WHO criteria of respiratory rate above the age specific cut-off, audible / ausculatory wheeze.

Administration of three courses of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) as intermittent preventive treatment (IPTi) to infants when they receive EPI vaccines reduced the incidence of malaria and anaemia in infants in an area with low SP resistance, low transmission pressure and high bednet use. However, it is not clear whether this observation can be generalised to areas with high transmission and high SP resistance. The mechanism of the protective effect of IPTi is unclear. There is an urgent need to identify other anti-malarial drugs that could be used for IPTi instead of SP. This study objectives are: 1. Identification of a drug that could be used safely and effectively for IPTi instead of SP in areas, such as north eastern Tanzania, where there is a high level of resistance to SP and amodiaquine. 2. Determination of whether a short acting antimalarial drug (Lapdap) is as effective as a long acting drug (mefloquine) when used for IPTi. 3. Investigation of the effect of the intensity of transmission on the requirements for a long or short acting drug for IPTi. 4. Assessment of the effect of IPTi on the development of clinical immunity in children in low and high transmission areas.

In endemic countries, anaemia has multiple causes such as nutritional deficiencies, infections and haemoglobinopathies. However, Plasmodium falciparum infection is believed to be the major contributory factor to the aetiology of severe anaemia. Severe anaemia is usually treated by blood transfusion although transfusion carries the attendant risk of transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Thus, there is a need to explore novel strategies to reduce the incidence of severe anaemia in high-risk groups such as children with suboptimal haemoglobin levels because these children are at increased risk of developing severe anaemia if they develop a malaria infection before their haemoglobin level has normalized. Therefore, it is proposed to study whether monthly chemoprophylaxis with sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) given during malaria transmission season can protect Gambian children from developing severe anaemia. After receiving treatment from the hospital, 1200 children admitted to the hospital with a haematocrit of less than 21% were randomised to receive either monthly S/P or placebo during the rest of the malaria transmission season.

Malaria is estimated to cause up to 2 million deaths and 500 million clinical episodes in Africa alone. The bulk of disease in Africa and severe disease and deaths globally is due to P. falciparum. However, P. vivax is also responsible for a substantial disease burden in endemic regions outside Africa, where P. vivax may account for more than half of all malaria cases. Efforts to reduce this unacceptably high disease burden are hampered by the limited availability of affordable interventions. Following the cessation of large-scale vector control in highly endemic areas, malaria control efforts have centred on early diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases and reducing exposure through the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). While ITNs have been shown to significantly reduce the burden of malaria additional effective interventions are urgently needed. Several trials have shown that chemoprophylaxis given to children at weekly or fortnightly intervals reduces morbidity from malaria in a number of different settings and populations. An alternative approach has been to use intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) involving the administration of a full therapeutic dose of antimalarials at regular intervals. This is logistically easier to deliver, and is less costly, and may reduce problems of promoting drug resistance associated with regular chemoprophylaxis. Intermittent administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) during antenatal clinic visits was shown to be highly effective in reducing malaria and anaemia in pregnant women and improving infant birth weights. IPT in pregnancy (IPTp) is now recommended by WHO for endemic regions of Africa.",Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTi) for the Prevention of Malaria and Anaemia in PNG Infants,Malaria; Anemia,n,n,less_developed,n,n,University of Melbourne; Case Western Reserve University,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,foundation,"Senn N, Rarau P, Manong D, et al.

The Ministry of Health, Division of Malaria Control (DOMC) rolled out the use of artemether-lumefantrine as the first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in 2006.The development of the ACTs and its derivatives are the most rapidly acting of all the current antimalarial drugs and recognition of their potential role as a component of combination therapy have led to several large trials aimed at assessing different combinations of existing drugs, and to the specific development of new combination drugs. This proposal aims to (1) evaluate the efficacy of artemisinin-based anti-malaria combination drugs in different sites across Kenya (2) elucidate the markers of resistance to ACTs through molecular genetics and in this process further strengthen capacity in the proposed study sites as well as improve links between research and control ultimately to influence malaria treatment policy and practice. Five groups in East Africa will conduct a multi-centre, randomised, two arm trial to assess the efficacy of dihydroartemisin-piperaquine with artemether-lumefantrine as the comparative drug. The network will determine antimalarial drug efficacy using standardised protocols and collate clinical responses and adverse events. Molecular markers to artemisinin resistance will be investigated by molecular sequencing and comparison of parasite profiles in drug failure cases. Recrudescence or re-infections will be differentiated by analysis of the MSP1, MSP2 and GLURP genes and assess transmission dynamics post treatment. Data from these studies will be captured into a database developed by the network.

However, it is associated with a high incidence of PostOperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV), severe pain and haemorrhage. There is strong evidence on the efficacy of Dexamethasone in reducing the incidence of PONV and pain after tonsillectomy, which led to consider this drug as a first line treatment in routine anaesthesia practice in such surgical setting. However, in the last decade, there have been arguments about the potential role of Dexamethasone in increasing the risk of postoperative bleeding in children and studies addressing the haemorrhage risk following administration of Dexamethasone for tonsillectomy are inconclusive.Thus, this study is aimed at providing evidence for the safety profile of Dexamethasone with regard to the risk of post-tonsillectomy bleeding in children when administered as a single intraoperative dose.","Dexamethasone and Postoperative Bleeding Following Tonsillectomy in Children: Double-blind, Randomized, Placebo Control, Multi-centre, International, Pragmatic, Non-inferiority Trial","Pain, Postoperative; Tonsillar Bleeding; Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting",n,n,notreported,n,n,"University Hospital, Geneva",NA,notavailable,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,3794,NA,NA,Drug; Drug,Dexamethasone; Sodium chloride,drug,Treatment,Reoperation for postoperative bleeding,"Respiratory complications; Pain scores; Postoperative nausea, vomiting and retching; Morbidity",2020-02-01T00:00:00Z,2019-12-01T00:00:00Z,45016,2020-04-21T00:00:00Z

This approach, called intermittent preventive treatment in children (IPTc) but now known as Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC), may also be useful in large areas of Africa where malaria is transmitted for longer each year. It is uncertain if IPTc would be effective, acceptable to communities or sustainable when delivered over a longer period, but this is an important public health question of key interest to policy makers, because in areas with a longer transmission season, the burden of malaria is typically higher than in highly seasonal areas. Another form of prevention that would be operationally easier for African countries to put into practice would be to treat malaria patients with long-lasting antimalarials, which protect children against further malaria episodes for several weeks. Because malaria disproportionately affects certain high risk children more than others, causing repeated attacks of fever and leading to severe anaemia, long-acting drugs may be a simple and effective way to target limited resources at the individuals who most need protection. This may be particularly beneficial where malaria is a seasonal problem, because repeated malaria attacks will not only be borne by a few unfortunate children, but will also occur close together in time. The investigators propose a clinical trial to evaluate these two forms of chemoprevention in Kumasi, Ghana, an area with an extended malaria transmission season. Children under 5 years of age currently have access to diagnosis and treatment of malaria via by community based health workers.

Besides adult health problems such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, obesity in childhood is associated with psychological and social problems, low self-esteem, stigmatization and being teased and bullied by friends. Danish research suggests that the causes behind the increase in obesity occurrence are present already in early childhood, and that prevention of obesity therefore has to start early. Research has suggested that at least three sub-groups can be considered at high risk of becoming obese: Children with obesity among their 1st degree relatives; children with a high birth weight or children coming from socially disadvantaged families (low socioeconomic status). Earlier intervention programs has showed little effect in preventing excessive weight gain and knowledge on how to develop effective intervention programs that reduce overweight and obesity remains limited. It has been suggested that future prevention programs may be more successful if specifically targeting groups that are at high risk, as mention above, of excessive weight gain. Based on these suggestions, the ""Sund Start"" project was initiated. The purpose of the study was to determine whether aiming prevention towards 2-6 years old Danish children who were yet normal weight, but were considered predisposed to becoming overweight or obese could prevent later on risk of becoming overweight or obese. Furthermore, to investigate if it was possible to improve diet habits, increase physical activity, reduce stress and improve sleeping habits among children at high risk for later on overweight and obesity. The ""Sund Start"" project will contribute with knowledge about whether targeting normal weight, predisposed children is effective in preventing overweight and obesity, and if reduced stress and improved sleep, should be considered important new obesity prevention tools. Moreover, the project will contribute with knowledge about how to change lifestyle and its effects on development of overweight and obesity in high risk Danish preschool children.","Prevention of Weight Gain Among Normal Weight, High Risk, Pre-school Children - a Randomized Controlled Interventions Study.",Overweight; Obesity; Predisposition,n,n,highly_developed,n,n,"TrygFonden, Denmark; The Danish Medical Research Council; Sygekassernes Helsefond",Tryg Foundation; Danish Medical Research Council,public; foundation,"Händel MN, Larsen SC, Rohde JF, Stougaard M, Olsen NJ, Heitmann BL.

Intervention: PRALIMAP-INÉS is a mixed prospective and multicenter trial of 1,250 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who are attending grade 9 and 10 in the 35 state-run schools of the Vosges department (northeastern France) for the academic years 2012-2013 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. Overweight adolescents (including obese) classified as advantaged are allocated to the standard-CM and those less advantaged are randomized to standard CM or strengthened-CM. The standard-CM consists of 5 collective sessions of 2 hr each performed in high school and supervised by a healthcare mobile team specialised in overweight and obesity care management for adolescents. The strengthened-CM consists of 5 collective sessions with the same standard operating procedure as the standard-CM with supplementary interventions between each session: strengthened solicitation with the adolescent and the family, peer-led educational sessions, motivational interviews, financial support for physical activity practice, cooking classes and multidisciplinary consultation meetings.

We postulate that controlling childhood vitamin D deficiency has the potential to dramatically reduce the incidence of pneumonia and save >700,000 lives each year since vitamin D deficiency is widespread in developing countries. Aim: To investigate whether 3-monthly oral supplementation of 100,000iu vitamin D reduces pneumonia and its consequences among children aged 1-12 months (followed for 18 months), living in a deprived area of Kabul, Afghanistan, where >70% of young children are vitamin D deficient (<8ng/dl). The effect of vitamin D on the incidence of other diseases, in particular diarrhea and rickets will also be investigated. Methods: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial: 3000 children will be randomised to receive either 6 doses of vitamin D or placebo. The first dose will be given at the start of autumn and the second and subsequent doses every 3 months thereafter; children will be followed for 18 months.

There is a demand for a reliable and consistent locally available severe acute malnutrition (SAM) treatment option since currently the only option is to use an imported ready-to-use-therapeutic food (RUTF). While imported RUTF is successful for treatment of children with SAM, Pakistan is often faced with supply chain issues and consequentially management of SAM with RUTF is unreliable. The World Food Programme (WFP)'s work in Pakistan supports government-led efforts to improve food and nutrition security, including the development of Acha Mum, a chickpea containing lipid-based ready-to-use-food. Acha Mum replaces the peanut in standard RUTF formulation with chickpea, a locally available legume. Acha Mum is well accepted by children in Pakistan and is currently being used as a treatment for children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in targeted supplementary feeding programs (TSFP) throughout the country. The broad objective of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of a chickpea-based specialized nutritious food Acha Mum, compared to a standard RUTF for the treatment of SAM. The study will be conducted in 10 basic health units (BHUs) operating by PPHI in Umerkot district of Sindh, Pakistan. This will be an individual randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical non-inferiority trial assessing the treatment of SAM with one of two therapeutic foods. A total of 1700 children will be part of the study (850 children in RUTF and 850 children in Acha Mum group).

Little is known about the impact of zinc supplementation of low birth weight (LBW) babies during first 6 months of life. Objective: The objectives were to determine the impact of daily zinc administration at 1RDA (5 mg) of elemental zinc to LBW infants on severe morbidity requiring hospitalization and on all cause mortality. Design: In a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial 2012 hospital-born infants with a birth weight <2500 g were randomly assigned to receive zinc or placebo for 6 months. Zinc group received 5 mg elemental zinc as acetate daily from 4 weeks age. Cause specific hospitalization deaths, episodes of diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, other illness, visits to health care providers and hospital OPDs were ascertained by in-depth interview and from documents like prescriptions, hospital tickets, medicine cartons at 3 and 6 months of age. Results: Number of infants with one or more diarrhea episodes was less by 17% (95% CI: 1% to 35%) in the zinc group but the numbers for ARI were similar in the two groups. The hospitalization rates due to all causes or diarrhea or ARI were similar in the two groups. Twelve in the zinc group and 9 in the placebo group died during 4 weeks to 6 months (p=0.36). We observed no significant difference for gain in weight and length at 3 months and 6 months between the groups.

It can be recognized as one of the key obstacles in national development, due to its influence on individual productivity, school performance and physical work capacity. Malnutrition is a hidden crisis in Pakistan, with rates increasing during the last decade. High prevalence of food insecurity, illiteracy, lack of nutritional knowledge, poor hygiene status, and under recognized role of nutrition are some of the possible causes. The situation of malnutrition in Pakistan necessitates an urgent need for addressing its causes through various nutrition interventions, in order to ensure a bright future for the coming generations. Although, malnutrition is a major problem across Pakistan, its burden and implications in the remote districts of Punjab are quite evident. The levels of undernutrition in district Rahim Yar Khan are high, with 47% of children being underweight. These numbers also highlight the presence of long-term undernutrition in the district, as evidenced by 45% of the children being stunted in 2014. Given the alarming situation of child malnutrition in district Rahim Yar Khan, the World Food Program (WFP) Pakistan is proposing an intervention program comprised of cash-based transfers, specialized nutritious foods and behaviours change communication to prevent stunting in district Rahim Yar Khan, province Punjab. The interventions will be delivered through the existing health system and Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). It is anticipated that the intervention will reduce the widespread macro and micro nutrient malnutrition and food insecurity in the targeted areas. Furthermore, to ensure the presence of adequate evidence to persuade policymakers for further scaling up, it is essential that an impact evaluation be conducted. Therefore, the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, Aga Khan University (AKU) using robust methodologies on a representative sample size in the district of Rahim Yar Khan to assess the effectiveness of the WFP interventions on process and outcome indicators.","Effectiveness of a Programme Comprised of SNF, Cash-based Transfers and BCC to Prevent Stunting Among Children 6-24 Months in Rahim Yar Khan, Punjab, Pakistan",Stunting,y,y,less_developed,n,n,"Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP); Department of Health, Government of Punjab; World Food Programme (WFP)",NA,notavailable,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,2179,2179,NA,Dietary Supplement; Behavioral; Other,SNF (Wawamum); Social and behaviour change communication (SBCC); Cash,supplement,Prevention,Reduction in stunting; SBCC package on the basis of formative research; Cost-effectiveness of intervention packages for prevention of stunting in children,"Weight gain in kilograms; Length gain in centimeters; Impact of the intervention on micronutrient deficiencies; Improvement in IYCF practices; Improved nutrition, hygiene and health related knowledge and practices; Proportion of households with moderate or severe hunger (food insecurity); Uptake of health services and interventions",2017-01-01T00:00:00Z,2017-08-12T00:00:00Z,43830,2020-03-19T00:00:00Z

Zinc deficiency is associated with impairment in immunological and other defenses against infection and increased rates of serious infections. Due to limitations in currently used biochemical markers, supplementation trials in populations likely to be deficient provide a reliable means of assessing health consequences of zinc deficiency. A significantly lower incidence and prevalence of diarrhea has been observed in zinc supplemented developing country children in several placebo-controlled trials.

The mechanisms aim of the trial is to determine whether there is a genetically highly-responsive subgroup of children. In designing this trial the investigators have incorporated several novel aspects. First, parents will be able to adjust the use of oral montelukast to their child's symptoms. This allows the investigators to recruit both ""episodic"" and ""multi trigger"" patterns of preschool wheeze - and control for any change in wheeze pattern during the trial. Second, before the investigators issue the trial medication, the investigators will assess children's leukotriene genes, focusing primarily on a gene called ALOX5. This ALOX5 ""stratification"" step will ensure that an equal number of potentially ""treatment-responsive"" children receive the active drug (montelukast) and the dummy medicine - and the equal numbers will help the investigators to assess the role of ALOX5. For the trial, the investigators will first recruit 1,300 children with a history of preschool wheeze, then divide them into the group with ""responsive"" and ""less responsive"" genes by their ALOX5 status. The investigators will then issue parents with the trial medication; 50% will be given montelukast and 50% will be given dummy medication. Parents will start the trial medication whenever their child develops a cold, and stop the medication when wheeze resolve. Parents will also be able to give the trial medication for wheeze between colds. Over the 12 month trial period, the investigators will assess the number of unscheduled attendances to a medical practitioner for wheeze for each child. At the end of the trial, the investigators will determine whether montelukast is effective then whether there is a difference in response to montelukast between the 2 ALOX5 gene groups. At the same time, the investigators will measure many other genes that may influence response to montelukast, as well as the amount of leukotrienes that are excreted in the urine before and during attacks. Using these results, the investigators will be able to both inform national treatment policy, and develop new concepts on the mechanism of preschool wheeze that will inform the development of new therapies. Since children will continue to receive ""normal"" inhaled therapy, there are no ethical issues in giving a dummy medicine to half of the 1300 children to be recruited.
