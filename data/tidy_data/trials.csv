NCT00132561,TRUE,NA,A Trial of Intermittent Treatment in the Prevention of Malaria in Senegalese Children,"In countries of the Sahel and sub-Sahel, malaria transmission is highly seasonal with nearly all infections occurring during a few months of the year. However, mortality and morbidity from malaria may be high during this period, especially in young children who are the group most at risk. Intermittent preventative treatment (IPT) is a new approach to the prevention of malaria in this situation. IPT involves the administration of an anti-malarial to children at risk for malaria at fixed times, even if they are not infected. To investigate how effective this approach might be in Senegal, a trial has been undertaken in which 1136 children aged 6 weeks to 59 months were given a single dose of sulfadoxine pyrimethamine and artesunate on three occasions during a three-month rainy season and the incidence of clinical malaria in these children was compared with that in a group of children who received placebo. Additional observations were made on the incidence of side effects in children in the two groups and on the impact of IPT in children (IPTc) on markers of drug resistance in children whose blood films were positive for Plasmodium falciparum.","A Double-blind, Randomised, Placebo-controlled Trial to Measure the Potential of Intermittent Treatment With Artesunate Plus Sulphadoxine/Pyrimethamine (SP) to Reduce the Malaria Burden in Sub-Saharan Africa",Malaria,NA,TRUE,33,32,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,United Kingdom,Senegal,UK,United Kingom,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,foundation,Other,NA,16503464,16503464,"Cissé B, Sokhna C, Boulanger D, et al.

NCT00548379,TRUE,NA,Kabul Vitamin D Supplementation Trial,"Background: Pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood mortality, accounting for 19% of the 10.6 million deaths that occur each year1. Case-control studies from Ethiopia2 and India3 suggest that sub-clinical vitamin D deficiency may increase ten times the risk of pneumonia in children. We postulate that controlling childhood vitamin D deficiency has the potential to dramatically reduce the incidence of pneumonia and save >700,000 lives each year since vitamin D deficiency is widespread in developing countries. Aim: To investigate whether 3-monthly oral supplementation of 100,000iu vitamin D reduces pneumonia and its consequences among children aged 1-12 months (followed for 18 months), living in a deprived area of Kabul, Afghanistan, where >70% of young children are vitamin D deficient (<8ng/dl). The effect of vitamin D on the incidence of other diseases, in particular diarrhea and rickets will also be investigated. Methods: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial: 3000 children will be randomised to receive either 6 doses of vitamin D or placebo. The first dose will be given at the start of autumn and the second and subsequent doses every 3 months thereafter; children will be followed for 18 months. Incidence of pneumonia will be ascertained though weekly home visits (active surveillance) and from attendances and admissions at the trial clinic and wards in the hospital serving the study area (passive surveillance).",The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on the Incidence of Pneumonia in Children in Afghanistan: a Randomized Controlled Trial,Pneumonia; Vitamin D Deficiency,"column J, column K",TRUE,22; 98,16,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,United Kingdom,Afghanistan,Afghanistan; Pakistan; UK,United Kingdom,WellcomeTrust; Development Partnership,nonprofit,Other,NA,25679979; 22494826,25679979; 22494826,"AR, Maroof Z, Chandramohan D, et al.

NCT00344006,TRUE,NA,Chlorproguanil-Dapsone-Artesunate Versus COARTEM For Uncomplicated Malaria,"Chlorproguanil-dapsone has been approved for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in a number of countries across sub-Sahara Africa, and by the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. CDA is a combination of chlorproguanil, dapsone and artesunate, being developed in a public-private partnership with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), World Health Organisation (WHO-TDR) and academic partners from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, University of Liverpool and the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine as a treatment for acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. The combination of chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate (CDA) is being developed to supersede chlorproguanil-dapsone for the same indication, but the addition of an artemisinin derivative, artesunate, should provide additional population benefits over chlorproguanil-dapsone alone. The artemisinins have been demonstrated to rapidly reduce parasite load and have activity against the sexual stages of the P.falciparum lifecycle. The addition of a second agent to the chlorproguanil-dapsone combination should also protect against the selection of resistant strains of P.falciparum. Artemether-lumefantrine is the only available fixed-dose Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy actually available and is considered as the gold standard for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria. This study will therefore aim to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the combination of CDA to artemether-lumefantrine in terms of efficacy at 28-days. The key secondary objectives will compare the Parasite Clearance Times (PCT) and the Fever Clearance Times (FCT) between CDA and artemether-lumefantrine.","A Multi-centre, Randomised, Double-blind, Double Dummy Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of Chlorproguanil-dapsone-artesunate Versus Artemether-lumefantrine in the Treatment of Acute Uncomplicated Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria in Children and Adolescents in Africa.","Malaria, Falciparum",NA,TRUE,33,32,<5; 5 - 14,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,United Kingdom,Tanzania; Kenya; Nigeria; Ghana; Burkina Faso,UK,United Kingdom,GlaxoSmithKline,industry,Industry,NA,19690618; 22993389; 21849081,19690618; 22993389; 21849081,"Premji Z, Umeh RE, Owusu-Agyei S, et al.

NCT00495690,TRUE,NA,Impact of Daily Zinc Supplementation to Infants Born With Low Birth Weight on Death and Severe Disease,"Title: Impact of daily zinc supplementation to infants born with low birth weight on mortality and severe disease requiring hospitalization Background: Zinc supplementation was shown to prevent diarrhea and pneumonia in 6 month to 3 year old children. Little is known about the impact of zinc supplementation of low birth weight (LBW) babies during first 6 months of life. Objective: The objectives were to determine the impact of daily zinc administration at 1RDA (5 mg) of elemental zinc to LBW infants on severe morbidity requiring hospitalization and on all cause mortality. Design: In a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial 2012 hospital-born infants with a birth weight <2500 g were randomly assigned to receive zinc or placebo for 6 months. Zinc group received 5 mg elemental zinc as acetate daily from 4 weeks age. Cause specific hospitalization deaths, episodes of diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, other illness, visits to health care providers and hospital OPDs were ascertained by in-depth interview and from documents like prescriptions, hospital tickets, medicine cartons at 3 and 6 months of age. Results: Number of infants with one or more diarrhea episodes was less by 17% (95% CI: 1% to 35%) in the zinc group but the numbers for ARI were similar in the two groups. The hospitalization rates due to all causes or diarrhea or ARI were similar in the two groups. Twelve in the zinc group and 9 in the placebo group died during 4 weeks to 6 months (p=0.36). We observed no significant difference for gain in weight and length at 3 months and 6 months between the groups. In a subgroup of infants the mean serum zinc concentration in the zinc group was 27% higher (p=0.004) than the placebo group.

NCT00285662,TRUE,NA,Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTi) for the Prevention of Malaria and Anaemia in PNG Infants,"In malaria-endemic areas, young children have an especially high risk of malaria morbidity and mortality. Malaria is estimated to cause up to 2 million deaths and 500 million clinical episodes in Africa alone. The bulk of disease in Africa and severe disease and deaths globally is due to P. falciparum. However, P. vivax is also responsible for a substantial disease burden in endemic regions outside Africa, where P. vivax may account for more than half of all malaria cases. Efforts to reduce this unacceptably high disease burden are hampered by the limited availability of affordable interventions. Following the cessation of large-scale vector control in highly endemic areas, malaria control efforts have centred on early diagnosis and treatment of clinical cases and reducing exposure through the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). While ITNs have been shown to significantly reduce the burden of malaria additional effective interventions are urgently needed. Several trials have shown that chemoprophylaxis given to children at weekly or fortnightly intervals reduces morbidity from malaria in a number of different settings and populations. An alternative approach has been to use intermittent preventive therapy (IPT) involving the administration of a full therapeutic dose of antimalarials at regular intervals. This is logistically easier to deliver, and is less costly, and may reduce problems of promoting drug resistance associated with regular chemoprophylaxis. Intermittent administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) during antenatal clinic visits was shown to be highly effective in reducing malaria and anaemia in pregnant women and improving infant birth weights.

NCT02433327,TRUE,NA,Paediatric Early Warning System - A Danish Multi-center Study,"Critical illness in the patient and death can potentially be predicted and prevented. Deterioration of the clinical condition of hospitalised patients is often preceded by physiological changes up to 24 hours before death. Despite this several reports show that lack of identification and proper actions in patients developing acute and critical illness remains a problem. The purpose of this study is to investigate if Paediatric early Warning Score (PEWS) optimises identification of acute and critically ill children and prevents life-threatening situations. The hypothesis is that implementation of PEWS supported by directions for action algorithms for intervention will have an impact on number of unplanned transfers to intensive care in already hospitalised children. This study is a multi-centre randomised controlled intervention study designed within a Complex Intervention framework; the study sheds light on the problem, validation of the data collection instrument, testing of the intervention and evaluation. The study involves all paediatric departments and some acute departments in Central Denmark Region. The study is designed as a randomised controlled intervention study where children are randomised to one of two different Paediatric Early Waning Score models. Development and implementation of PEWS is expected to contribute to reduce the number of children developing acute critical illness, number of admissions to intensive care. PEWS is also expected to contribute to increase professional skills and competences in health professionals. It is expected that this study will contribute towards working with a joint PEWS model in Denmark.

NCT03655314,TRUE,NA,Using the Electronic Health Record to Guide Management of Newborn Weight Loss,"Weight loss is normal for healthy newborns in the first few days, especially for those exclusively breastfed, who may have low enteral intake for several days. Although most newborns tolerate this early period of weight loss well, those with pronounced weight loss become at increased risk of feeding problems and hyperbilirubinemia, which are the two most common causes of neonatal readmission. To facilitate the assessment of risk for an individual newborn, the Newborn Weight Tool (NEWT) has been developed to categorize each infant's weight loss according to population norms, so that formula can be administered when weight loss is pronounced and avoided when weight loss is normal. The Healthy Start study will be a randomized, controlled trial testing whether displaying NEWT to clinicians providing newborn care can improve neonatal health outcomes including formula use, weight loss and readmission. Newborns will be randomly assigned either to display weight with NEWT weight categorization to their providers in the electronic health record (EHR) or to usual care (weight displayed without NEWT categorization).",Beginning With a Healthy Start: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Informatics-Enhanced Newborn Weight Management,"Breastfeeding; Breastfeeding, Exclusive; Morbidity;Perinatal; Feeding, Bottle",k,TRUE,88,76,<5,highly_developed,NA,NA,NA,United States,USA,"NA",United States,NA,notavailable,Other,NA,no_publication,NA,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,2386,0,NA,0,NA,"Active, not recruiting",Completed,2020-03-26T00:00:00Z,Other; Other,NEWT; Usual care,NA,medical_algorithm,NA

NCT03078842,TRUE,NA,Zinc Dosing Trial - Does Dose Reduction Reduce Side Effects But Retain Efficacy in Diarrhoea Management,"Diarrhoea continues to be a major cause of child deaths. Current treatment of acute watery diarrhoea includes oral rehydration solution (ORS), zinc and continued feeding. The use of zinc is based on a number of studies that showed that zinc reduces the duration and severity of diarrhoea. The recommended dose of zinc in 6-59 month old children is 20mg/day for 10-14 days. This dose is associated with an increased risk of vomiting. No dosing studies are available to determine the optimal dose of zinc, which while maintaining the benefits also has a low risk of vomiting. The investigators will conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial of three doses of zinc (20mg/day, 10mg/day and 5mg/day) in two settings - one in Sub-Saharan Africa and the other in South Asia. The study population will be 4500 children with diarrhoea of less than 72 hours duration who are aged 6-59 months. They will be recruited from outpatient health facilities. All enrolled children will receive ORS and continued feeding as recommended by the World Health Organization. Those allocated to the standard zinc dose will receive an oral dispersible tablet with 20mg zinc daily for 14 days. Those allocated to lower dose zinc will receive identical tablets with either 10mg or 5mg zinc daily for 14 days. Enrolled children will be followed by until recovery from diarrhoea or 15 days after enrolment, whichever is later. In addition, study children will be assessed again at thirty (30), forty-five (45), and sixty (60) days to estimate impact on post illness outcomes.

It can be recognized as one of the key obstacles in national development, due to its influence on individual productivity, school performance and physical work capacity. Malnutrition is a hidden crisis in Pakistan, with rates increasing during the last decade. High prevalence of food insecurity, illiteracy, lack of nutritional knowledge, poor hygiene status, and under recognized role of nutrition are some of the possible causes. The situation of malnutrition in Pakistan necessitates an urgent need for addressing its causes through various nutrition interventions, in order to ensure a bright future for the coming generations. Although, malnutrition is a major problem across Pakistan, its burden and implications in the remote districts of Punjab are quite evident. The levels of undernutrition in district Rahim Yar Khan are high, with 47% of children being underweight. These numbers also highlight the presence of long-term undernutrition in the district, as evidenced by 45% of the children being stunted in 2014. Given the alarming situation of child malnutrition in district Rahim Yar Khan, the World Food Program (WFP) Pakistan is proposing an intervention program comprised of cash-based transfers, specialized nutritious foods and behaviours change communication to prevent stunting in district Rahim Yar Khan, province Punjab. The interventions will be delivered through the existing health system and Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). It is anticipated that the intervention will reduce the widespread macro and micro nutrient malnutrition and food insecurity in the targeted areas. Furthermore, to ensure the presence of adequate evidence to persuade policymakers for further scaling up, it is essential that an impact evaluation be conducted.

NCT01350063,TRUE,Randomized by household,Health Impact of Treating and Safely Storing Shallow Tubewell Drinking Water,"When shallow tubewells replaced highly contaminated surface water as the primary source of drinking water in Bangladesh in the late 20th century, contemporary studies demonstrated no reduction in diarrheal disease with this improvement in water source. This lack of improvement in transitioning to tubewells is consistent with the lack of significant health gains observed in intervention studies focusing on water quality improvements at the source. In contrast, high quality intervention studies that improve water quality at the point of use through treatment of water in households show a 39% reduction in diarrhea. The primary objective of this study is within a typical setting in rural Bangladesh where households use shallow tubewell water for drinking. The investigators will randomly assign 1800 households who have a child between the ages of six months and two years to one of three groups. Group 1 will receive a safe water storage vessel with a lid and a narrow mouth/tap and Aquatabs, an effervescent water purification tablet that utilizes sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) as the chlorine donor. Group 2 will only receive a safe water storage vessel with a lid and a narrow mouth/tap. Group 3 will receive no water intervention and continue their standard habits and practices. Every month a field research assistant will visit each participating household and collect information on the prevalence of diarrhea among children between the ages of six months and two years, as well as children between the ages of two and five years if present in the household.

NCT01142505,TRUE,NA,Wheeze and Intermittent Treatment,"The clinical aim of this trial is to assess whether intermittent montelukast is an effective treatment strategy in preschool wheeze. The mechanisms aim of the trial is to determine whether there is a genetically highly-responsive subgroup of children. In designing this trial the investigators have incorporated several novel aspects. First, parents will be able to adjust the use of oral montelukast to their child's symptoms. This allows the investigators to recruit both ""episodic"" and ""multi trigger"" patterns of preschool wheeze - and control for any change in wheeze pattern during the trial. Second, before the investigators issue the trial medication, the investigators will assess children's leukotriene genes, focusing primarily on a gene called ALOX5. This ALOX5 ""stratification"" step will ensure that an equal number of potentially ""treatment-responsive"" children receive the active drug (montelukast) and the dummy medicine - and the equal numbers will help the investigators to assess the role of ALOX5. For the trial, the investigators will first recruit 1,300 children with a history of preschool wheeze, then divide them into the group with ""responsive"" and ""less responsive"" genes by their ALOX5 status. The investigators will then issue parents with the trial medication; 50% will be given montelukast and 50% will be given dummy medication. Parents will start the trial medication whenever their child develops a cold, and stop the medication when wheeze resolve. Parents will also be able to give the trial medication for wheeze between colds. Over the 12 month trial period, the investigators will assess the number of unscheduled attendances to a medical practitioner for wheeze for each child. At the end of the trial, the investigators will determine whether montelukast is effective then whether there is a difference in response to montelukast between the 2 ALOX5 gene groups. At the same time, the investigators will measure many other genes that may influence response to montelukast, as well as the amount of leukotrienes that are excreted in the urine before and during attacks. Using these results, the investigators will be able to both inform national treatment policy, and develop new concepts on the mechanism of preschool wheeze that will inform the development of new therapies. Since children will continue to receive ""normal"" inhaled therapy, there are no ethical issues in giving a dummy medicine to half of the 1300 children to be recruited. The study will be the largest trial in wheezy preschool children to date, and may open up genetic testing in preschool wheeze.",Parent-determined Oral Montelukast Therapy for Preschool Wheeze With Stratification for Arachidonate-5-Lipoxygenase (ALOX5) Promoter Genotype,Wheezing,NA,TRUE,168,168,<5; 5 - 14,highly_developed,NA,NA,NA,United Kingdom,UK,UK,United Kingdom,UK Medical research council,public,Other,NA,26632627; 25212745; 28153869,25212745,"Nwokoro C, Pandya H, Turner S, et al.

NCT01727609,TRUE,NA,Speed of Increasing Milk Feeds Trial,"Survival of preterm infants has increased greatly over the years, so a major aim now is to improve the long term outlook for these babies and to avoid serious complications. The way babies are fed in early life affects short and long-term health and survival. Because the bowels of preterm infants have not matured, they cannot digest large volumes of milk feeds straight away. Until the gut matures, nutrition is provided by intravenous drip while the amount of milk given is gradually increased over time. Increasing the amount of milk rapidly may increase the risk of gut complications. Increasing the amount of milk given more slowly means that intravenous nutrition is needed for longer; there is an associated risk of infection proportional to the time the intravenous line is present in the bloodstream of these infants. Despite the importance of milk feeding preterm infants, there have been few studies to inform how best to balance these risks, and what the best way to increase feeds in these infants is - this study sets out to address this missing information. The study will compare two different speeds of milk feed increase, one 'faster' and one 'slower', both within rates currently used in United Kingdom neonatal units. The study aims to find out if either speed of milk feed increase gives better outcomes for the infants. Investigators will measure a variety of outcomes, such as survival without disability, infection, bowel problems, growth and long-term physical and mental development, as well as the impact on families and the National Health Service, including costs.

NCT02225769,TRUE,NA,Electronic Algorithms Based on Host Biomarkers to Manage Febrile Children,"Health professionals in developing countries have limited ability to identify children at risk of dying and those in need of antibiotics. The main reasons are limited clinical skills and time, unavailability of diagnostic tests (laboratory or x-ray) and non-adherence to practice guidelines. Child mortality is therefore higher than it should be. Etiological diagnostic tests (detecting microorganisms) may not always help since the distinction between infection and disease and between mild or severe disease is not straightforward. Overprescription of antibiotics is therefore widespread and leads to the development of drug resistance. To address these challenges, decision charts for the management of febrile illness will be developed and include i) few clinical parameters simple to assess, and ii) POCTs results based on specific host markers that can discriminate between mild and severe disease, pneumonia and upper respiratory tract infections, and unspecific fevers of bacterial and of viral origin. This algorithm combining clinical and bedside laboratory tests will be built on an electronic support (android tablet). The first objective of the study is to assess the safety of new electronic decision trees that integrate simple clinical assessment and POCTs results (oxygen saturation and a combination of specific biomarkers of inflammation) as a triage tool to decide on admitting febrile children; the second objective is to assess the usefulness and safety of new electronic decision trees that integrate simple clinical assessment and POCT results (a combination of specific biomarkers of inflammation) as decision-making tool to prescribe antibiotics to non-severe febrile children. The development of such a tool will decrease mortality due to delayed admission, At the same time, it will decrease irrational use of antibiotics, and hence drug pressure and emergence of drug resistance, which represents one of the most important public health threat our world is facing today. This project has the potential of huge applicability since it is specifically designed for end-users with limited medical skills and low resources, as it is the case in most areas of developing countries.",Electronic Algorithms Based on Host Biomarkers Point of Care Tests to Decide on Admission and Antibiotic Prescription in Tanzanian Febrile Children,Acute Febrile Illness,NA,TRUE,58,58,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,Switzerland,Tanzania,Switzerland,Switzerland,Swiss National Science Foundation’s R4D Program; Thrasher Research Fund,public,Other,NA,30715250; 29059253,29059253,"Keitel K, Samaka J, Masimba J, et al.

NCT00561899,TRUE,NA,Comparison of Three Drug Combinations for Intermittent Treatment of Malaria in Children,"Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) offers a way of preventing malaria infection without compromising the development of malaria immunity or encouraging drug resistance. The effect of IPT in children in the prevention of malaria has been evaluated in a number of trials in areas of seasonal malaria transmission. Results from these trials have shown that IPTc provided between 40% - 86% protection against clinical malaria. In 2006, a trial that compared two methods of IPTc delivery was carried out in Upper River Division, The Gambia. Preliminary results of the trial have shown that the treatment was very effective as only 4% (45/1133) of the children seen at the end of year cross-sectional survey were parasitaemic. Tolerability was assessed in a subset of 1100 children and the results showed that about 13.5% of children developed mild to moderate vomiting. Malaise was present in about 10% of the study subjects. Severe adverse events were rare. Thus it is important to investigate if other drug regimens might be equally effective in preventing malaria but less likely to cause adverse events. During the 2007 malaria transmission season, 1009 children aged 1-5 years will be individually randomized to receive amodiaquine plus SP, piperaquine plus SP or Artekin TM (dihdroartemisinin plus piperaquine) at monthly intervals on three occasions during the months of September, October, and November. To determine the prevalence of side effects following drug administration participants in each treatment group will be visited at home three and seven days after each round of drug administration and a side effects questionnaire completed. To help establish whether these adverse events are drug related, the same questionnaire will be administered after each treatment round, to 286 age-matched children who are not part of the trial. The primary ends points will be the incidence of adverse events.","Comparison of Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Three Drug Combinations for Intermittent Preventive Treatment in Children Aged 1-5 Years in an Area of Seasonal Malaria Transmission in Upper River Division, The Gambia",Malaria,NA,TRUE,33,32,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,The Gambia,Gambia,UK; Gambia,United Kingdom,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,foundation,Other,NA,20574538,20574538,"Bojang K, Akor F, Bittaye O, et al.

Two rates of rehydration will be compared; a more rapid rate and a slower rate. Within each of these two basic rehydration protocols, the investigators will vary the type of rehydration fluid used (0.9% saline or 0.45% saline). The investigators will compare the different treatments by conducting assessments of neurological injury, by measuring the frequency of significant cerebral edema, and by measuring long-term neurocognitive function. These studies will allow us to determine whether variations in IV fluid treatment protocols affect acute neurological outcomes of DKA. Additionally, they will provide important data regarding the impact of DKA and DKA treatment on long-term neurocognitive function in children. In this way, the investigators hope to identify a more ideal fluid management strategy for children with DKA. Previous studies have suggested that DKA may cause blood flow to the brain to be reduced and that brain injury might result from this reduction in blood flow and/or the effects of re-establishment of normal blood flow during DKA treatment with insulin and iv fluids. The investigators hypothesize that more rapidly re-establishing normal blood flow to the brain during DKA, by giving fluids more rapidly and using fluids with a higher sodium (salt) content, will help to minimize brain injury caused by DKA.",Fluid Therapy and Cerebral Injury in Pediatric Diabetic Ketoacidosis,Cerebral Edema; Diabetic Ketoacidosis,K,TRUE,231,230,<5; 5-14; 15+,highly_developed,NA,NA,NA,United States,USA,USA,United States,NA,public,Other|NIH,NA,no_publication,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1389,1389,NA,1389,NA,Completed,Completed,NA,Drug; Drug; Drug; Drug,0.45% saline replacement fluid; 0.9% saline replacement fluid; 0.45% saline intravenous fluid; 0.9% saline Intravenous fluid,AJ; AK,NA,intravenous

Due to limitations in currently used biochemical markers, supplementation trials in populations likely to be deficient provide a reliable means of assessing health consequences of zinc deficiency. A significantly lower incidence and prevalence of diarrhea has been observed in zinc supplemented developing country children in several placebo-controlled trials. The effect of routine zinc supplementation on lower respiratory tract infection is still unclear. We, therefore, evaluated the impact of daily zinc supplementation in a representative sample of children aged 6 to 30 months enrolled from a New Delhi slum area, with a sample size sufficient to determine the impact on the incidence of severe diarrhea and acute lower respiratory infection.","Effect of Zinc and Vitamin A Supplementation on Diarrhea, Physical Growth and Immune Response in Malnourished Children",Diarrhea; Pneumonia; Acute Respiratory Tract Infection,"J, K",TRUE,22; 26; 94,16,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,India,India,India; Norway,Norway,European Union; Norwegian Council of Universities' Committee for Development Research and Education; Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development (CAH); World Health Organization,public,Other,NA,22013199; 23283502; 20107146; 21525251,NA,"Manger MS, Taneja S, Strand TA, et al.

Three alternative regimens will be compared with a standard (reference) regimen of injectable procaine-benzyl penicillin and gentamicin once daily each for seven days. Alternative regimens are (1) injectable gentamicin once daily and oral amoxicillin twice daily for seven days; (2) injectable penicillin and gentamicin once daily for two days followed by oral amoxicillin twice daily for five days; and (3) injectable gentamicin once daily and oral amoxicillin twice daily for two days followed by oral amoxicillin twice daily for five days. Hypothesis The proportion who fails treatment will be 10 percent in the reference group and the alternative treatment groups. An alternative therapy will be considered non-inferior to the standard therapy if the failure rate in the alternative therapy exceeds the failure rate in the injectable therapy by less than 5 absolute percentage points.

NCT00272142,TRUE,NA,"Impact of Zinc Supplementation in Low Birth Weight Infants on Severe Morbidity, Mortality and Zinc Status: A Randomized Controlled Trial","There are currently no interventions available to substantially reduce the incidence of low birth weight (LBW) apart from increasing the age at marriage, maternal iron supplementation and possibly improved energy intakes. The current view of the medical and public health community in India is that the immediate focus should be on promoting survival and development of low birth weight infants who have nearly a 6 to 7 fold higher mortality during infancy than those with normal birth weight. Low serum zinc is associated with increased incidence of diarrhea and pneumonia. There is sufficient evidence in under-threes that during acute illness, zinc supplementation (1-2 recommended dietary allowance [RDA]) reduces incidence of all episodes of diarrhea, severe diarrhea and pneumonia. A number of initial published trials also show significant effect of zinc treatment on pneumonia. With the large and consistent effects of zinc supplementation on the incidence and severity of infections, an effect on child mortality is likely. Available literature suggests the distinct possibility of reduced neonatal and infant mortality in LBWs receiving 1 RDA of zinc daily. A pilot study in India showed a 54% reduction in mortality in LBW infants. These findings were based on a very small sample and therefore considered insufficient to change policy. A positive impact in the proposed study will provide an important tool for reduction of infant mortality which is currently stagnant and government acceptance for such a program is likely to be very high. We, the researchers at the Society for Applied Studies, believe this study has the potential for decreasing infant mortality from its current level.","Impact of Zinc Supplementation in Low Birth Weight Infants on Severe Morbidity, Mortality and Zinc Status: A Randomized Controlled Trial",Diarrhea; Respiratory Infection; Low Birth Weight,NA,TRUE,93,76,<5,B,less_developed,NA,NA,India,India,USA; India,World Health Organization; United States,Kenneth and Linda Pollin Foundation; New York Presbyterian Hospital; Columbia University; Department of Child and Adolescent Health and Development; World Health Organization,public; foundation,Other,NA,19553296,NA,"Taneja S, Bhandari N, Rongsen-Chandola T, Mahalanabis D, Fontaine O, Bhan MK.

NCT00131716,TRUE,NA,Prevention of Severe Anaemia in Gambian Children,"Severe anaemia is a frequent cause of admission to hospitals in tropical Africa and about 10% of such children die. In endemic countries, anaemia has multiple causes such as nutritional deficiencies, infections and haemoglobinopathies. However, Plasmodium falciparum infection is believed to be the major contributory factor to the aetiology of severe anaemia. Severe anaemia is usually treated by blood transfusion although transfusion carries the attendant risk of transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Thus, there is a need to explore novel strategies to reduce the incidence of severe anaemia in high-risk groups such as children with suboptimal haemoglobin levels because these children are at increased risk of developing severe anaemia if they develop a malaria infection before their haemoglobin level has normalized. Therefore, it is proposed to study whether monthly chemoprophylaxis with sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (S/P) given during malaria transmission season can protect Gambian children from developing severe anaemia. After receiving treatment from the hospital, 1200 children admitted to the hospital with a haematocrit of less than 21% were randomised to receive either monthly S/P or placebo during the rest of the malaria transmission season. Morbidity was monitored throughout the rainy season.

For some, however, the arch does not fully form or it might be flat against the ground. When this happens, it is known as having flat feet which can cause pain in the feet, legs, or back. At the moment, we are not sure what the best treatment for flat feet is, so the purpose of this research is to conduct a trial to compare three of the most common treatments that are used today. Two of the treatments are different types of insoles, which are put inside the shoe. The third treatment is some exercises and advice about which types of shoes might help. Participants will receive their treatment as part of their normal National Health System care. We would like 1055 children and young people aged between six and 16 years old to take part in the study. Everyone will receive advice about the type of shoes to wear, ankle exercises and things to look out for when children have painful flat feet. In addition to this, 422 of the participants will receive an insole that is individually customised for them, whilst another 422 will receive a pre-made insole that is the right size. We will ask for their help for 12 months. During this time, we will track their progress by sending them three questionnaires in the post to fill in and weekly text messages to find out how painful their feet are during the first few months. We also want to learn more about the problems that flat feet cause, and children's experiences of the treatments delivered as part of this clinical trial. We will explore this through in-depth conversations with children and their parent(s) or the person who looks after them.

It is generally acknowledged that breastfeeding is one of the main pillars in allergy prevention. Infant formulas based on hydrolysed proteins have been developed to be used by infants at increased risk of developing allergy in case a mother is unable or chooses not to breastfeed her infant. The effect of hydrolysed formula in allergy prevention has been examined in many studies, from which it can be concluded that currently there is not sufficient evidence to support hydrolysed protein over intact protein for allergy risk reduction. Moreover, several clinical trials support the suggestion of supplementation of pre and/or probiotics for the reduction of eczema development, recognized by international authorities. The present study (MAESTRO) investigates the preventive effect of a hypoallergenic concept combining several nutritional approaches related to preventive strategies: partially hydrolysed protein formula supplemented with prebiotics and probiotics. The aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy, growth and safety of this concept compared to standard (intact protein) infant formula on the development of allergic manifestations up to the age of 12 months in infants at increased risk of developing allergy.","A Randomised, Double-blind, Controlled, Parallel-group, Multi-country Study to Investigate the Effect of a Partially Hydrolysed Infant Formula With Added Synbiotics on the Development of Allergic Manifestations in Infants at High Risk of Developing Allergy",Immunity,NA,TRUE,311,276,<5,NA,NA,NA,NA,notprovided,"NA","NA",France,Nutricia Research,industry,Industry,NA,no_publication,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1700,0,NA,0,NA,Not yet recruiting,Not yet recruiting,2019-05-03T00:00:00Z,Other; Other,Infant Formula with added synbiotics; Standard Infant formula,AJ,NA,NA

NCT02606565,TRUE,NA,Efficacy of Umbilical Cord Cleansing With a Single Application of 4% Chlorhexidine for the Prevention of Newborn Infections in Uganda: a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Nearly all the yearly 3.3 million neonatal deaths occur in low and middle income countries. Infections, including those affecting the umbilical cord (omphalitis) are a significant factor in approximately a third of these deaths. In fact, the odds of all-cause mortality are 46% higher among infants with umbilical cord infection than those without infection. Five large randomized controlled trials in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have examined the effect of multiple applications (for at least 7 days) of 4% chlorhexidine (CHX) on the umbilical cord on omphalitis and neonatal death. These studies show a consitent positive effect of multiple applications on omphalitis but not on neonatal mortality. Whereas there is mounting evidence for the effect of 7 day chlorhexidine application, there is no data from Africa and only one study from Asia that examines the effect of a single application of CHX as soon as possible after birth. In this single Asian study, CHX led to a reduction in the risk of mild-moderate omphalitis and neonatal death. It is important, in an African setting to explore the effect of a single application, which is programmatically much simpler to implement than daily application for 7 days. Therefore, the investigators' study will compare umbilical cord cleansing with a single application of 4% chlorhexidine at birth with dry cord care in both community and facility births on omphalitis and severe illness in the neonatal period. Methods: The chlorhexidine study is a community based, individually randomised controlled trial conducted on 4,760 mother-infant pairs in Uganda.

NCT03181958,TRUE,NA,A Trial Comparing Noninvasive Ventilation Strategies in Preterm Infants Following Extubation,"Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is the main cause of respiratory failure in preterm neonates, its incidence varying from 80% to 25% depending on gestational age.When optimal prenatal care is provided, the best approach to treat RDS, according to several recent trials,consists in providing continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) from the first minutes of life using short binasal prongs or masks, followed by early selective surfactant administration for babies with worsening oxygenation and/or increasing work of breathing. Any effort should be done to minimize the time under invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV).Nonetheless, clinical trials have shown that a relevant proportion of preterm neonates fails this approach and eventually need IMV.The duration of IMV is a well known risk factor for the development of broncho-pulmonary dysplasia (BPD) - a condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. To minimize the duration of IMV, various non invasive respiratory support modalities are available in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). CPAP is presently the most common technique used in this regard. However, a systematic review has shown that non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) reduces the need for IMV (within one week from extubation) more effectively than NCPAP, although it is not clear if NIPPV may reduce need for intubation longterm and it seems to have no effect on BPD and mortality. NIPPV main drawback is the lack of synchronization, which is difficult to be accurately achieved and is usually unavailable. A more recent alternative technique is non-invasive high frequency oscillatory ventilation (NHFOV) which consists on the application of a bias flow generating a continuous distending positive pressure with oscillations superimposed on spontaneous tidal breathing with no need for synchronization. The physiological, biological and clinical details about NHFOV have been described elsewhere. To date, there is only one small observational uncontrolled study about the use of NHFOV after extubation in preterm infants. Other relatively small case series or retrospective cohort studies suggested safety, feasibility and possible usefulness of NHFOV and have been reviewed elsewhere.The only randomized trial published so far compared NHFOV to biphasic CPAP,in babies failing CPAP and it has been criticized for methodological flaws and for not taking into account respiratory physiology.An European survey showed that, despite the absence of large randomized clinical trials, NHFOV is quite widely used, at least in some Countries and no major side effects are reported, although large data about NHFOV safety are lacking. This may be due to the relative NHFOV easiness of use but evidence-based and physiology-driven data are warranted about this technique.",Nasal High Frequency Oscillation Ventilation(NHFOV) vs. Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure(NCPAP) vs Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation（NIPPV） as Post-extubation Respiratory Support in Preterm Infants With Respiratory Distress Syndrome:a Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial,Intubated Infants Were Intend to Extubation Using Noninvasive Ventilation Strategies,NA,TRUE,89,76,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,China,China,China,China,Chongqing Medical Research Unit,industry,Other|Industry,NA,31349833,NA,"Shi Y, De Luca D; NASal OscillatioN post-Extubation (NASONE) study group.

NCT03130114,TRUE,NA,Antibiotics for Children With Severe Diarrhoea,"Although the current World Health Organization (WHO) recommended management package for acute diarrhoea (ORS, zinc and feeding advice) has contributed to significant reductions in diarrhoea associated mortality, over half a million children continue to die annually as a result of acute diarrhoeal episodes. In addition, rates of mortality in young children in the 90 days following an episode of acute diarrhoea appear at least as high as mortality that occurs during the acute episode. The long-term benefits of antibiotic administration may result from direct antimicrobial effects on pathogens or from other incompletely understood mechanisms including improved nutrition, alterations in immune tolerance or improved enteric function. Optimizing antibiotic treatment of acute diarrhoea episodes in very young children with severe disease may offer the opportunity to significantly reduce diarrhoea associated deaths in the 180 days following presentation for acute diarrhoea and may also improve growth.

NCT03643276,TRUE,NA,Treatment Protocol for Children and Adolescents With Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia - AIEOP-BFM ALL 2017,"The understanding of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in childhood and adolescence has largely changed due to extensive genetic research in recent years: ALL is now considered to be a very heterogeneous disease group. The leukemia cells present themselves with quite differently activated regulatory mechanisms of the malignant phenotype. The introduction of more accurate methods of assessing therapy response (""minimal residual disease [MRD] tests"") has provided new insights into very different mechanisms of action, including factors influenced by host factors; this has had practical clinical consequences for the use of more individualized therapy. Multimodal therapies have enabled a cure level of over 80% for ALL in this age group. However, the own and international study data show that the therapy toxicity of the contemporary chemotherapy concepts has become unacceptably high, in particular with respect to those intensified therapies used for the treatment of patients at high risk of ALL relapse. The AIEOP-BFM ALL 2017 study therefore aims for an innovative integrated approach that will not only adapt the risk stratification to new prognostic markers using more comprehensive diagnostics, but above all, qualitatively reorient the therapy. The most important consequence will be that this study is testing immunotherapy with the bispecific antibody blinatumomab as an alternative to particularly intensive and toxic chemotherapy elements in precursor B-cell ALL (pB-ALL) patients with detectable chemotherapy resistance and at high risk of relapse. With the aim to complement the effects of the conventional chemotherapy, Blinatumomab is in addition tested in the large group of pB-ALL patients at intermediate relapse risk with seemingly unremarkable leukemia, but who account for a large proportion of all relapses.

NCT01214473,TRUE,NA,Probiotics for Prevention Neonatal Infection,"Neonatal sepsis (serious infection) continues to be one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the newborn period around the world. India, with one of the world's largest populations, continues to struggle with extremely high infant and neonatal mortality rates. Sepsis accounts for 50% of deaths among community born (and 20% of mortality among hospital-born) infants. Closely linked with this is a burgeoning problem of antimicrobial resistance, which is increasingly restricting the therapeutic options for medical care providers. Friendly bacteria called ""Probiotics"" have been used in multiple infectious and inflammatory disease states in humans. Fructooligosaccharides are sugars found naturally in many fruits and vegetables and also in human breast milk. These sugars reach the colon undigested and serve as food for the friendly bacteria. The current study uses a probiotic preparation containing Lactobacillus plantarum and fructooligosaccharides as an attempt to prevent neonatal infections. Currently no conclusive data are available on the utility of probiotics in such conditions. If successful, such inexpensive preventive therapy can be made available to general public in resource poor countries. Similar preparations can also be used in the western world to prevent similar infectious conditions of the neonatal period, especially in preterm infants where sepsis continues to be a major cause of hospital stay and death.",Prevention of Neonatal Infection in the Indian Community Setting Using Probiotics,Neonatal Sepsis; Sepsis; Neonatal Infections,NA,TRUE,91,76,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,United States,India,USA,United States,NA,public,Other|NIH,NA,no_publication,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4556,4556,NA,4556,NA,Terminated,Terminated,NA,Other; Other,Synbiotics; Maltodextrin,NA,supplement,NA

The PRALIMAP trial highlighted the effectiveness of structured screening and care management in decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity in high school adolescents over 2 years. The PRALIMAP-INES trial aims to investigate whether a strengthened care management (CM) for socially less advantaged adolescents in school in the short and long term has an equivalent effect as a standard-CM on decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity among socially advantaged adolescents. Intervention: PRALIMAP-INÉS is a mixed prospective and multicenter trial of 1,250 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who are attending grade 9 and 10 in the 35 state-run schools of the Vosges department (northeastern France) for the academic years 2012-2013 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. Overweight adolescents (including obese) classified as advantaged are allocated to the standard-CM and those less advantaged are randomized to standard CM or strengthened-CM. The standard-CM consists of 5 collective sessions of 2 hr each performed in high school and supervised by a healthcare mobile team specialised in overweight and obesity care management for adolescents. The strengthened-CM consists of 5 collective sessions with the same standard operating procedure as the standard-CM with supplementary interventions between each session: strengthened solicitation with the adolescent and the family, peer-led educational sessions, motivational interviews, financial support for physical activity practice, cooking classes and multidisciplinary consultation meetings. Data on sociodemographics, anthropometrics, physical activity and mental health are collected at 3 visits: at the entry to grade 9 or 10 (before the intervention=T0), at the end of grade 9 or 10 (at the end of the intervention=T1) and at the end of grade 11 (1 year after the intervention=T2).

NCT00944840,TRUE,NA,Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPTc) and Home Based Management of Malaria (HMM)in The Gambia,"Malaria in African countries remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity among young children. The global malaria control strategies include prompt treatment with an effective antimalarial drug, vector control using ITNs or curtains, indoor residual spraying (IRS), and intermittent preventive treatment. However, individually these interventions provide only imperfect protection. Thus, there is a need to investigate whether additional control measures provide added benefit in reducing mortality and morbidity. Therefore, 1312 children under 5 years of age living in villages and hamlets near Farafenni, The Gambia, which form part of the rural Farafenni Demographic Surveillance system (FDSS) in North Bank Region(NBR) were randomly allocated to receive IPTc or placebo from village health workers based in primary health care villages.

NCT00310258,TRUE,NA,Drug Use Prevention Among Girls Through a Mother-Daughter Intervention,"This study will develop and test drug use prevention strategies for low-income, minority girls. Gender-specific substance use rates, risk and protective factors, and health outcomes highlight the need for interventions aimed at girls. Girls and boys share a number of risk factors, yet some factors are more salient for one gender. Girls and boys may also be affected differently by the same risk factors. Intervention planned for this study emphasizes risk and protective factors that impact girls. Our intervention will build mother-daughter communication and closeness; enhance girls' self-efficacy and body esteem; nurture girls' conflict management, problem-solving, stress reduction, and refusal skills; correct perceived norms; build social supports; and establish patterns of parental monitoring and supervision. We hypothesise that girls who receive GSI will have lower 3-year follow-up rates of substance use than girls who receive no intervention. The study will occur in three phases. In a 12-month preparation phase, we will refine and complete intervention and measurement protocols, recruit subjects and randomly assign girls and mothers to study arms, and pretest girls and mothers. A 12-month implementation phase will initiate field operations of the clinical trial, including intervention delivery, process data collection, and posttests. Follow-up in the last 36 months will involve longitudinal measurements of girls and mothers, booster session development and delivery, and data analyses.",Drug Abuse Prevention: A Mother-Daughter Intervention,Adolescent Behavior,NA,TRUE,224,222,5 - 14,highly_developed,NA,NA,NA,United States,USA,USA,United States,NIDA,public,NIH,NA,no_publication,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2000,0,NA,0,NA,Completed,Completed,NA,Behavioral,Drug use prevention intervention,NA,behavioral_intervention,substance_abuse
NCT00158574,TRUE,NA,Kilimanjaro IPTi Drug Options Trial,"Malaria and anaemia are major causes of morbidity and mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa. Administration of three courses of sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) as intermittent preventive treatment (IPTi) to infants when they receive EPI vaccines reduced the incidence of malaria and anaemia in infants in an area with low SP resistance, low transmission pressure and high bednet use. However, it is not clear whether this observation can be generalised to areas with high transmission and high SP resistance. The mechanism of the protective effect of IPTi is unclear. There is an urgent need to identify other anti-malarial drugs that could be used for IPTi instead of SP. This study objectives are: 1. Identification of a drug that could be used safely and effectively for IPTi instead of SP in areas, such as north eastern Tanzania, where there is a high level of resistance to SP and amodiaquine. 2. Determination of whether a short acting antimalarial drug (Lapdap) is as effective as a long acting drug (mefloquine) when used for IPTi. 3. Investigation of the effect of the intensity of transmission on the requirements for a long or short acting drug for IPTi. 4. Assessment of the effect of IPTi on the development of clinical immunity in children in low and high transmission areas. A randomised trial with four treatment regimes is proposed which will be conducted in two different transmission settings. The four treatment regimens are as follows: (1) placebo; (2) mefloquine; (3) Lapdap; (4) SP. All medications will be given at the time of immunisation with DPT/polio 2, DPT/polio 3, and measles vaccines. The study will involve 1280 infants in a high endemic area and 2440 infants in a low endemic area, in Tanzania.The primary outcome is the incidence of clinical malaria.",Drug Options for Intermittent Preventive Treatment for Malaria in Infants in an Area With High Resistance to Sulfadoxine/Pyrimethamine: an Evaluation of Short and Long-acting Antimalarial Drugs,Malaria,NA,TRUE,33,32,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,United Kingdom,Tanzania,UK; Denmark,United Kingdom,Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,foundation,Other,NA,20209126; 19765815,NA,"Cairns M, Gosling R, Carneiro I, et al.

NCT01029717,TRUE,NA,CATCH - Catheter Infections in Children,"Most children admitted to paediatric intensive care units (PICU) need to have medicines given to them into their veins using a narrow tube, so they do not need repeated injections. This tube is called a central venous catheter. Occasionally these catheters can cause infections in the blood and sometimes the tubes can get blocked by small blood clots. Some intensive care units already use antibiotic or heparin coated catheters, but there is no proof that these are better than the standard ones at preventing infections. Most of the PICU's in this country use standard lines. The only way to find out for certain is to compare children who are given antibiotic or heparin coated catheters with those who are given standard ones in a clinical trial. Because we do not know which type of catheter is best, the type of catheter each child receives in the study will be decided randomly by chance. Each child in the trial will have the same chance of getting any of these three catheters: - Standard central venous catheter (not coated). - Heparin coated central venous catheter. Heparin is a medicine that can stop blood from clotting and might stop the tubes being blocked and infections in the blood. - Antibiotic coated central venous catheter. Antibiotics can be used to kill bacteria which cause the infections. The aim of this study is to see how the three types of catheters compare in reducing the amount of blood infections in children. We will also look at the costs involved. We hope to recruit 1200 children in the UK over 2 years. We hope that the information we get from this study will guide policy about purchasing impregnated Central Venous Catheters across the NHS and thereby improve treatment for children in the future.",A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing the Effectiveness of Heparin Bonded or Antibiotic Impregnated Central Venous Catheters (CVCs) With Standard CVCs for the Prevention of Hospital Acquired Blood Stream Infection in Children,Catheter-Related Infections,NA,TRUE,75,58,<5; 5-14,highly_developed,NA,NA,NA,United Kingdom,UK,UK,United Kingdom,"national institutes of health, UK",public,Other,NA,26935961,NA,"Harron K, Mok Q, Dwan K, et al.

This large individually randomized controlled trial will enroll 10500 low birth weight babies. The secondary objectives are examining the impact of the intervention on exclusive breast feeding and growth at 1 and 3 months, infections and hospitalizations in the neonatal period and from 1 to 5 months of age, recognition of illnesses and early care seeking from appropriate sources, motor and mental development in a subsample. Newborns weighing >=1500 to <=2250gm are being enrolled into the study within 3 days of birth. Eligible babies are randomized to intervention or control arms. Mothers in the intervention arm are supported for KMC and breastfeeding by study ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife) and study ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) like workers . Routine home visits are conducted in both intervention and control arms by government workers according to the existing government program. Survival will be ascertained in all enrolled infants through contacts at 1, 3 and 6 months.

NCT00182312,TRUE,NA,Caffeine for Apnea of Prematurity (CAP),"At least 5 of every 1000 live-born babies are very premature and weigh only 500 to 1250 grams at birth. Approximately 30-40% of these high-risk infants either die or survive with lasting disabilities. The aim of this research is to reduce this heavy burden of illness. A multi-center randomized controlled trial has been designed in which 2000 very low birth weight infants will be enrolled. Our goal is to determine whether the avoidance of methylxanthine drugs will improve survival without disability to 18 months, corrected for prematurity. Methylxanthine drugs such as caffeine are used to prevent or treat periodic breathing and breath-holding spells in premature infants. However, there is a striking lack of evidence for the long-term efficacy and safety of this therapy. Methylxanthines block a naturally occurring substance, called adenosine, which protects the brain during episodes of oxygen deficiency. Such episodes are common in infants who are treated with methylxanthines. It is possible that methylxanthines may worsen the damage caused by lack of oxygen. Therefore, this trial will clarify whether methylxanthines cause more good than harm in very low birth weight infants.",Efficacy and Safety of Methylxanthines in Very Low Birthweight Infants,Apnea of Prematurity,NA,TRUE,89,76,<5,highly_developed,NA,NA,NA,Australia; Canada,USA; Australia; Canada; Germany; Israel; Netherlands; Sweden; Switzerland; UK,Canada; Australia,Canada; Australia,Canadian Institutes of Health Research; National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia,public,Other,NA,16707748; 17989382; 28437520; 28707987; 25784749; 21173002; 25641237,NA,"Schmidt B, Roberts RS, Davis P, et al.

NCT02112734,TRUE,NA,Can Vitamin D Supplementation in Infants Prevent Food Allergy in the First Year of Life? The VITALITY Trial,"There is an urgent need to prevent the onset and progression of food allergy in our population. Evidence demonstrates that food allergy and atopic eczema represent the earliest manifestations of the atopic march with 50% of infants with food allergy predicted to develop respiratory allergic diseases later in life. We report that Australia has the highest prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the world, with 10% of infants having challenge-proven food allergy in Melbourne. There has been a 5-fold increase in hospital admissions for life-threatening anaphylaxis. These changes are most pronounced in children less than 5 years, suggesting a causal role for early life determinants. We have primary data to inform hypotheses for the rise in food allergy, which appears to result from potentially modifiable factors related to the modern lifestyle, particularly Vitamin D insufficiency (VDI), and have demonstrated an association between VDI and increased risk of challenge-proven food allergy in 12-month old infants, which supports numerous ecological studies showing an increased risk of food allergy the further a child resides from the equator (associated with decreased UV exposure and Vitamin D levels). Despite Australia's sunny climate, population rates of VDI have steadily increased in infants and pregnant women in parallel to the apparent rise in food allergic disease. This association is biologically plausible, as there is evidence Vitamin D is critical to the healthy development of the immune system in early life. We propose an intervention study to assess if infant Vitamin D supplementation during the first year of life significantly decreases the risk of early-onset food allergy. Australia is ideally placed to answer this important question since, unlike the USA, Canada and Europe, there are no population recommendations for routine infant supplementation with Vitamin D and we are one of the few developed countries that do not supplement the food chain supply with Vitamin D.",Can Vitamin D Supplementation in Infants Prevent Food Allergy in the First Year of Life?

NCT00640263,TRUE,NA,Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Infant Peri-exposure Prophylaxis With Lopinavir/Ritonavir Versus Lamivudine to Prevent HIV-1 Transmission by Breastfeeding,"The ANRS 12174 study is a clinical trial that will compare the efficacy and safety of prolonged infant peri-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) with Lopinavir/Ritonavir (LPV/r) versus Lamivudine to prevent HIV-1 transmission through breast milk in children born to HIV-1-infected mothers not eligible for HAART and having benefited from perinatal antiretroviral (ART) regimens. The study will recruit 1500 mother-infant pairs in 4 African countries. Study design: PROMISE PEP is a multinational, randomised double-blind controlled clinical trial. Intervention: Infants will be randomised to receive LPV/r or 3TC twice daily from day seven (± 2 days) after birth until 4 weeks after cessation of breastfeeding (BF). We will recommend exclusive BF (EBF) up till including the 26th week of life followed by a relatively rapid (maximum of 8 weeks) cessation period. The maximum duration of PEP will thereby be 38 weeks. Primary objective: To compare the efficacy of infant LPV/r (40/10mg twice daily if 2-4kg and 80/20mg twice daily if >4kg) vs. Lamivudine 7,5mg twice daily if 2-4kg, 25mg twice daily if 4-8kg and 50mg twice daily if >8kg) from day 7 until 4 weeks after cessation of BF (maximum duration of prophylaxis: 50 weeks for a maximum duration of breastfeeding of 46 weeks) to prevent postnatal HIV-1 acquisition between 7 days and 50 weeks of age. Secondary objectives: - To assess the safety of long-term infant prophylaxis with LPV/r versus Lamivudine (including resistance, adverse events and growth) until 50 weeks. - HIV-1-free survival until 50 weeks - To build clinical trials capacity at the four study sites. Main endpoint: Acquisition of HIV-1 (as assessed by HIV-1 DNA PCR) between day 7 and 50 weeks of age Study population: HIV-uninfected infants at day 7 (± 2 days) born to HIV-1 infected mothers not eligible for HAART who choose to breastfeed their infants and who have benefited from the national prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) program during pregnancy and delivery. The study will recruit 1500 mother-infant pairs in Burkina Faso, South Africa, Uganda and Zambia. Study duration: Infants will be followed up for 50 weeks and the total study duration is five years.

NCT03640403,TRUE,NA,Effectiveness and Safety of Intermittent Preventive Treatment for Malaria Using Either Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or Artesunate-amodiaquine in Reducing Malaria Related Morbidities and Improving Cognitive Ability in School-aged Children in Tanzania,"Background: In high-transmission settings, up to 70% of school-aged children harbour malaria parasites which is mostly asymptomatic, thus, from an epidemiological point of view, they contribute significantly as reservoir to onward malaria transmission to others. In endemic areas, malaria accounts for around 50% of the mortality, 13-50% of all school absenteeism, and causes anaemia in approximately 85 million school-aged children of sub Saharan Africa that also impairs the cognitive development of children. Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of pregnant women as well as seasonal malaria chemoprevention in children under the age of five have been implemented in several sub-Saharan countries and have proven to be very effective. However, none of these IPT strategies is targeting school children. A clinical trial is being conducted to expand the IPT by testing effectiveness and safety of two antimalarial drugs Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and Artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) in preventing malaria related morbidity in school aged children (IPTsc) living in high endemic areas. Methods: A randomized, open label, controlled trial will enrol 1602 school children aged 5-15 years, who will receive either DP or ASAQ or control (no drug ), using a ""balanced block design"" with the ""standard of care"" arm as reference. The interventional treatments are given every 4 months 3 rounds for the first year. A second non-interventional year will assess possible rebound effects. All study-arms receive bed nets, early diagnosis and care for malaria, and praziquantel and albendazole as mass treatment for helminthiasis. The primary endpoint are change from baseline in mean haemoglobin concentration at months 12 and 20 of follow-up and clinical malaria incidence from month 0 till months 12 and 20 of follow up. Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study. Mixed design methods will be used to assess the acceptability, cost-effectiveness and feasibility of this IPTsc as part of a more comprehensive school children health package. Discussion: The national school health programme (NSHP), Tanzania, combines schistosomiasis and soil transmitted helminthes (STH) control package under national schistosomiasis and STH control programme (NSSCP). Malaria intervention using IPTsc strategy may be integrated in NSHP with the same platform as NSSCP, however, there is limited systematic evidence to assess the operational feasibility of this approach. School aged children are a reachable target population in any endemic malaria setting. The suggested strategy will provide effective protection against malaria, hasten either the elimination process and/or diminish the reservoir and burden.",Effectiveness and Safety of Intermittent Preventive Treatment for Malaria Using Either Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine or Artesunate-amodiaquine in Reducing Malaria Related Morbidities and Improving Cognitive Ability in School-aged Children in Tanzania: A Controlled Randomised Trial,"Malaria,Falciparum; Anemia",NA,TRUE,33,32,5 - 14,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,Belgium; Tanzania,Tanzania,Belgium,Tanzania,Flemish Inter-university Council,public,Other,NA,32382685,NA,"Makenga G, Baraka V, Francis F, et al.

NCT01651416,TRUE,NA,Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention Versus Home Management of Malaria in Children Under 5 Years in Ghana,"In areas of Africa where malaria is only a problem during a short rainy season, monthly courses of antimalarial drugs can provide very effective prevention of malaria in children. This approach, called intermittent preventive treatment in children (IPTc) but now known as Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC), may also be useful in large areas of Africa where malaria is transmitted for longer each year. It is uncertain if IPTc would be effective, acceptable to communities or sustainable when delivered over a longer period, but this is an important public health question of key interest to policy makers, because in areas with a longer transmission season, the burden of malaria is typically higher than in highly seasonal areas. Another form of prevention that would be operationally easier for African countries to put into practice would be to treat malaria patients with long-lasting antimalarials, which protect children against further malaria episodes for several weeks. Because malaria disproportionately affects certain high risk children more than others, causing repeated attacks of fever and leading to severe anaemia, long-acting drugs may be a simple and effective way to target limited resources at the individuals who most need protection. This may be particularly beneficial where malaria is a seasonal problem, because repeated malaria attacks will not only be borne by a few unfortunate children, but will also occur close together in time. The investigators propose a clinical trial to evaluate these two forms of chemoprevention in Kumasi, Ghana, an area with an extended malaria transmission season. Children under 5 years of age currently have access to diagnosis and treatment of malaria via by community based health workers. Children enrolled in the study will receive either the standard community-based diagnosis and treatment, treatment with a longer-acting artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), or standard care plus five monthly courses of seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) during the peak in transmission.",An Individually Randomised Trial of Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention Versus a Long-acting Artemisinin Combination Therapy for the Prevention of Malaria and Anaemia in Children Living in an Area of Extended Seasonal Transmission in Ghana.,Malaria; Anaemia,"J, K",TRUE,33,32,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,Ghana,Ghana,UK; Ghana,Ghana,NA,notavailable,Other,NA,no_publication,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2400,2400,NA,2400,NA,Completed,Completed,NA,Drug; Drug; Drug,Artemether-lumefantrine combination; Dihydroartemisinin Piperaquine combination; Amodiaquine plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine combination,NA,drug,oral

NCT01583335,TRUE,NA,The Healthy Start Project: Primary Prevention of Overweight in Preschool Children Predisposed to Future Overweight,"Obesity prevention should remain a priority, although there is some evidence of a possible leveling off in some age groups across European countries and in USA, Japan and Australia. Besides adult health problems such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, obesity in childhood is associated with psychological and social problems, low self-esteem, stigmatization and being teased and bullied by friends. Danish research suggests that the causes behind the increase in obesity occurrence are present already in early childhood, and that prevention of obesity therefore has to start early. Research has suggested that at least three sub-groups can be considered at high risk of becoming obese: Children with obesity among their 1st degree relatives; children with a high birth weight or children coming from socially disadvantaged families (low socioeconomic status). Earlier intervention programs has showed little effect in preventing excessive weight gain and knowledge on how to develop effective intervention programs that reduce overweight and obesity remains limited. It has been suggested that future prevention programs may be more successful if specifically targeting groups that are at high risk, as mention above, of excessive weight gain. Based on these suggestions, the ""Sund Start"" project was initiated. The purpose of the study was to determine whether aiming prevention towards 2-6 years old Danish children who were yet normal weight, but were considered predisposed to becoming overweight or obese could prevent later on risk of becoming overweight or obese. Furthermore, to investigate if it was possible to improve diet habits, increase physical activity, reduce stress and improve sleeping habits among children at high risk for later on overweight and obesity. The ""Sund Start"" project will contribute with knowledge about whether targeting normal weight, predisposed children is effective in preventing overweight and obesity, and if reduced stress and improved sleep, should be considered important new obesity prevention tools. Moreover, the project will contribute with knowledge about how to change lifestyle and its effects on development of overweight and obesity in high risk Danish preschool children.","Prevention of Weight Gain Among Normal Weight, High Risk, Pre-school Children - a Randomized Controlled Interventions Study.",Overweight; Obesity; Predisposition,NA,TRUE,311,276,<5,highly_developed,NA,NA,NA,Denmark,Denmark,Denmark,Denmark,Tryg Foundation; Danish Medical Research Council,public; foundation,Other|Industry,NA,28991907; 30308484; 22852799,NA,"Händel MN, Larsen SC, Rohde JF, Stougaard M, Olsen NJ, Heitmann BL.

There is a demand for a reliable and consistent locally available severe acute malnutrition (SAM) treatment option since currently the only option is to use an imported ready-to-use-therapeutic food (RUTF). While imported RUTF is successful for treatment of children with SAM, Pakistan is often faced with supply chain issues and consequentially management of SAM with RUTF is unreliable. The World Food Programme (WFP)'s work in Pakistan supports government-led efforts to improve food and nutrition security, including the development of Acha Mum, a chickpea containing lipid-based ready-to-use-food. Acha Mum replaces the peanut in standard RUTF formulation with chickpea, a locally available legume. Acha Mum is well accepted by children in Pakistan and is currently being used as a treatment for children with moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) in targeted supplementary feeding programs (TSFP) throughout the country. The broad objective of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of a chickpea-based specialized nutritious food Acha Mum, compared to a standard RUTF for the treatment of SAM. The study will be conducted in 10 basic health units (BHUs) operating by PPHI in Umerkot district of Sindh, Pakistan. This will be an individual randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical non-inferiority trial assessing the treatment of SAM with one of two therapeutic foods. A total of 1700 children will be part of the study (850 children in RUTF and 850 children in Acha Mum group).

NCT00407394,TRUE,NA,Indiaclen Short Course Amoxycillin Therapy for Pneumonia With Wheeze,"Background: The current Integrated management of childhood infections (IMCI) algorithm prescribes that children with wheeze and fast breathing presenting to first level health facilities are given antibiotics if they continue to have fast breathing after two doses of bronchodilator. The primary purpose of the algorithm is to prevent mortality due to bacterial pneumonia. However, an unknown proportion of children managed in this fashion will have a viral related wheezing illness or asthma rather than pneumonia. Although it is unlikely that wheezing syndromes are a significant cause of mortality for children in developing countries, these algorithms are likely to result in unnecessary administration of antibiotics as well as inadequate treatment of recurrent wheezing illness. We do not have clear evidence about whether antibiotics can be withheld in some categories of children with wheeze. It is clear that wheeze can occur in bacterial infection and in addition co-infection with virus and bacteria has been well demonstrated in several studies of pneumonia etiology in children. Although some studies have found that children with more severe disease or who are blood culture positive are more likely to be febrile at presentation, this sign is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to determine whether antibiotics should be administeredSetting: The study will be conducted in eight medical colleges situated in Lucknow, Nagpur, New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Trivandrum, Vellore, and Chandigarh. Design: This will be a multicentric, randomized, double blind efficacy trial. . Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that the use of oral amoxycillin for three days would be as effective, in terms of clinical cure on day 4 as compared to use of oral placeboMain objective: To compare the proportion of children aged 2 to 59 months presenting with non-severe pneumonia with wheeze whose respiratory rate does not fall below the age specific cut-off after three doses of nebulized salbutamol, that achieve clinical cure on day 4 on 3 day of treatment with oral amoxycillin versus placebo.Inclusion criteria: Children aged 2-59 months with non-severe pneumonia based on WHO criteria of respiratory rate above the age specific cut-off, audible / ausculatory wheeze. Exclusion criteria: Children with severe disease, received any documented antibiotic treatment in the past 48 hours, diagnosed asthmatic on maintenance therapy, complicating acute non-pulmonary or chronic illness, known drug allergy, hospitalization in the past 2 weeks, history of measles within the last month, known immunodeficiency disorder, prior enrollment in the study, residing in areas not accessible for follow-up or whose guardian refuses to consent for the study.

NCT00433212,TRUE,NA,Nasal Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation in Premature Infants (NIPPV),"The machines and oxygen used to help very premature babies breathe can have side-effects, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Infants with BPD get more complications (a higher death rate, a longer time in intensive care and on assisted ventilation, more hospital readmissions in the first year of life, and more learning problems) than infants who do not develop BPD. Doctors try to remove the tube in the wind-pipe that links the baby to the breathing machine as soon as possible. However, small babies get tired, and still require help to breathe. One of the standard and common techniques to help them breathe without a tube in the wind-pipe is to use simple pressure support, nasal continuous positive airway pressure or nCPAP. This supports breathing a little, but it is often not enough to prevent the need to go back on the breathing machine. Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is similar to nCPAP, but also gives some breaths, or extra support, to babies through a small tube in the nose. NIPPV is safe and effective, and already in use as an alternate ""standard"" therapy.

NCT03682653,TRUE,NA,"Neonates and Azithromycin, an Innovation in the Treatment of Children in Burkina Faso","Although under-5 mortality rates are declining globally, neonatal mortality remains persistently high in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. Mass azithromycin distribution to children aged 1-59 months has been shown to reduce childhood mortality in Niger, Tanzania, and Malawi. This study did not evaluate the effect of azithromycin administered during the neonatal period. Observational evidence from high income countries has suggested that macrolides, including erythromycin and azithromycin, may be associated with increased risk of development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). However, these studies are limited by confounding by indication, as infants only receive antibiotics when they are ill. The investigators proposed an individually randomized trial of azithromycin versus placebo to establish the efficacy and safety of administration of a dose of azithromycin during the neonatal period. The long-term goal is generate evidence that can be used by neonatal and child survival programs related to the use of azithromycin in the youngest children who have the highest risk of mortality. The investigators hypothesize that a single dose of azithromycin administered in the neonatal period will lead to significantly reduced risk of mortality and that this dose will be safe. Objectives 1.

Affordable home-based treatments can prevent many of these deaths, with success rates over 97.5% if malnutrition is identified early. If identified late, treatment failure rates increase to 16%. Malnutrition programs currently rely on community health volunteers to screen children, which can lead to high costs, low screening coverage, and late identification. Mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) is the preferred community malnutrition screening tool. Training mothers to use MUAC tapes to monitor their child's nutritional status through a short message service (SMS) mobile health system could increase screening coverage and facilitate rapid engagement with nutritional services where necessary.

Participants will be taught to measure their child's MUAC at 6 or 9-month immunization visits and during 6-month follow up the participants will receive a weekly SMS prompting them to measure and send their child's MUAC to a computer system which will alert a health worker when a child with malnutrition is identified.

NCT00325247,TRUE,NA,Efficacy of Zinc Therapy in Acute Diarrhoea in Young Children,"Diarrhoea continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity in young children especially in many developing countries. Although the mortality burden of diarrhoea has substantially reduced, the morbidity pattern remained almost unchanged. Recent randomized controlled supplementation trials in developing countries have consistently shown that zinc has the potential to reduce the duration of diarrhoea as well as has preventive effect on childhood diarhroea in subsequent months. Currently, international health agencies recommend zinc as an important adjunct therapy to treat diarrhoea in developing countries where zinc deficiency is highly prevalent and diet is poor in zinc. The recommendation is to provide 20 mg elemental zinc daily for 10 days during each episode of diarrhoea. This study aims at evaluating the relative efficacy of two length of 20 mg zinc therapy (5 vs 10 days) during acute diarrhoea in a rural community in a community-based individually randomized placebo-controlled trial with 20 mg zinc daily and will be conducted in seven villages in the ICDDR,B Matlab study area. The study will require 2050 acute dirrhoeal episodes to be treated who will be randomly allocated to one of the two treatment schedules (20 mg of zinc daily for 5 or 10 days). Children who will be allocated to the shorter duration therapy will receive placebo for the remaining days to complete 10-day treatment. Female Field Workers (FFWs) will conduct diarrhoea surveillance and administer zinc daily at home. Data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical procedure. Findings of this study will be immensely valuable for deciding recommendation for the duration of zinc therapy in the management of acute diarrhoea in young children and will have profound programmatic and policy implications for scaling up zinc intervention in the community.",Efficacy of Short Course Zinc Therapy (5 vs 10 d) With 20 mg Elemental Zinc Daily in the Treatment of Acute Diarrhoea: A Double-blind Individually Randomized Controlled Community Trial.,Acute Watery Diarrhoea,NA,TRUE,26,25,<5,NA,less_developed,NA,NA,Bangladesh,Bangladesh,Bangladesh,Bangladesh,bill and melinda,foundation,Other,NA,21147907,NA,"Alam DS, Yunus M, El Arifeen S, et al.

NCT00127998,TRUE,unclear randomization?,Antimalarial Drug Resistance in Mali,"Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum (malaria) to current antimalarial drugs and the continuing development of resistance to new antimalarial formulations is one of the major obstacles to effective malaria control and case management. Efficient, comprehensive and validated methods for monitoring drug resistance in advance of the development of resistance to the antimalarial drugs that are in use are urgently needed. Molecular markers of genetic polymorphisms that give rise to resistant P. falciparum parasites and methods in population genetics for evaluating the data can be valuable tools for monitoring drug resistance in the field. This study aims to: 1. Prospectively measure the in vivo response of P. falciparum malaria in Mali to several different antimalarial drugs and drug combinations: chloroquine (CQ), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), amodiaquine (AQ), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in combination with amodiaquine (SP/AQ), amodiaquine in combination with artesunate (AQ/AS), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in combination with artesunate (SP/AS), and artemether-lumefantrine (Co-artem). In one site with preliminary data showing a high rate of P. falciparum resistance to mefloquine (MQ), this drug will also be tested. 2. Measure the frequencies of molecular markers for antimalarial drug resistance, and examine how those results relate to the efficacy of these drugs in treating clinical malaria 3. Measure drug levels at 3 days and correlate with efficacy results. 4. Examine early clinical, parasitologic, and clinical predictors of late treatment failure. 5.

The Ministry of Health, Division of Malaria Control (DOMC) rolled out the use of artemether-lumefantrine as the first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in 2006.The development of the ACTs and its derivatives are the most rapidly acting of all the current antimalarial drugs and recognition of their potential role as a component of combination therapy have led to several large trials aimed at assessing different combinations of existing drugs, and to the specific development of new combination drugs. This proposal aims to (1) evaluate the efficacy of artemisinin-based anti-malaria combination drugs in different sites across Kenya (2) elucidate the markers of resistance to ACTs through molecular genetics and in this process further strengthen capacity in the proposed study sites as well as improve links between research and control ultimately to influence malaria treatment policy and practice. Five groups in East Africa will conduct a multi-centre, randomised, two arm trial to assess the efficacy of dihydroartemisin-piperaquine with artemether-lumefantrine as the comparative drug. The network will determine antimalarial drug efficacy using standardised protocols and collate clinical responses and adverse events. Molecular markers to artemisinin resistance will be investigated by molecular sequencing and comparison of parasite profiles in drug failure cases. Recrudescence or re-infections will be differentiated by analysis of the MSP1, MSP2 and GLURP genes and assess transmission dynamics post treatment.

Presently, approximately 70 percent of children in the United States are currently enrolled in early childcare facilities, making this an ideal setting to implement and evaluate childhood obesity prevention efforts. We describe here the methods for conducting an obesity prevention intervention randomized trial in the child care setting. Methods/Design: A randomized, controlled obesity prevention trial in 28 low-income, ethnically diverse child care centers located throughout Miami-Dade County, FL is currently being conducted over two years (2010-present) to test the efficacy of an intervention that poises teachers and parents as lifestyle change agents. The Healthy Caregivers-Healthy Children (HC2) program includes a curriculum focusing specifically on healthy food choices, increased exercise, and role modeling. The program targets food policy changes throughout the school, and via the child, caregiver, and teacher. Major outcome measures include child body mass index percentile and z score, fruit and vegetable and other nutritious food intake, and amount of physical activity. Discussion: Although few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life, this period may represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention. Findings from this investigation should inform both the fields of childhood obesity prevention and early childhood research about the effects of an obesity prevention program housed in the childcare setting. (H1) A child care center-based obesity prevention intervention program that includes a teacher and parent nutritional gatekeeper and role modeling program will be more effective in maintaining BMI in 3-5 year olds compared to a control group.

Setting: The study will be conducted in 18 rural primary health center (PHC) in 9 districts in India near Lucknow, Nagpur, New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Trivandrum, Vellore, Chandigarh and Bhopal. Design: The unit of randomization will be the PHC. The recruited children will be followed up on days 4, 6 and 13-15 to assess primary and secondary outcome measures. Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis is that the clinical failure rate with use of either oral amoxycillin for three days or five days co-trimoxazole is similar. Intervention: Oral Co-trimoxazole (8mg/kg/day trimithoprim) twice a day for five days vs. oral amoxycillin (20 mg/kg/day) thrice a day for three days. Main objective: To compare the proportion of children aged 2 to 59 months presenting with non-severe pneumonia with or without wheeze, who do achieve clinical cure on day 6 on treatment with 5 days oral co-trimoxazole and 3 day oral amoxycillin, respectively. Main outcomes measures: Clinical cure on day 6; clinical failure between day 1-6; clinical relapse between day 7-15. Inclusion criteria: Children aged 2-59 months with non-severe pneumonia based on WHO criteria of respiratory rate above the age specific cut-off with or without wheeze, accessible to follow up, whose guardians give written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: Children with severe disease, other infectious disease requiring antibiotic treatment, documented use of antibiotic for the last 48 hours, three or more episodes of wheezing in a year, diagnosed asthmatics, known immunodeficiency disease, acute or chronic organic disease, history of hospitalization within last 15 days, measles within last one month, drug allergy, refusal to give consent, prior enrollment in the study. Sample size: Has been calculated to test the null hypothesis. There will be 1100 children in each arm. Thus each PHC is required to recruit a minimum of 122 cases within one year.

NCT04167566,FALSE,not RCT (cohort study),"Impact of Scaling up Mass Testing, Treatment and Tracking on Malaria Prevalence Among Children","Malaria poses a serious burden in sub-Sahara Africa. Efforts are ongoing to scale up interventions that work. These include the use of Long Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLIN), Intermittent Preventive Treatment in children (IPTc), and test, treat and track (TTT). There is the need, however, for mass testing, treatment and tracking (MTTT) of the whole population to reduce the parasite load before implementing the aforementioned interventions. Though, Seasonal Malaria Chemoprophylaxis (SMC) is adopted for selected localities in Ghana, the impact of such interventions could be enhanced, if associated with MTTT in order to reduce the parasite load at baseline. MTTT of children in Ghana has demonstrated a parasite load reduction from 25% to 1%. However, unanswered questions include - could this be scaled up? What proportion of the community could be covered over a given time? What would it take to accomplish large scale MTTT? In designing interventions that aim at reducing the burden of malaria in children under five, for example, MTTT has largely been left out. Adults who are not often targeted by such interventions remain reservoirs that fuel transmission. This study explores the scale-up of interventions that work using existing community volunteer teams to lower cost. These volunteers will play a surveillance role by conducting home-based management of malaria. To avoid challenges posed by stockouts, short message service (SMS) will be used to monitor the level of stocks for malaria medicine and Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs). It is hypothesized that there are more asymptomatic malaria cases (those who carry the parasite but are not ill) than symptomatic cases reported by hospital records in the Pakro sub district and that, carrying out MTTT in combination with home-based management of malaria in specific communities could greatly reduce the burden. Through this study, the bottlenecks that hinder scaling-up of MTTT will be documented in order to facilitate the process.","Exploring the Impact of Scaling up Mass Testing, Treatment and Tracking on Malaria Prevalence Among Children in the Pakro Sub District of Ghana","Malaria; Malaria, Asymptomatic Parasitaemia",NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5000,5000,NA,5000,NA,Completed,Completed,NA,Combination Product,Artemisinin Combination Therapy ACTs,NA,NA,NA

During adolescence physical activity (PA) decreases and is likely an important contributor to the increasing trend in childhood obesity rates. Little evidence suggests that school-based curriculum interventions lead to increases in overall PA. Thus, this proposal will evaluate the efficacy of an innovative motivational and behavioral skills after-school program for promoting increases PA among underserved adolescents (e.g., minorities, low SES). The motivational plus behavioral skills intervention is consistent with Self-Determination (Motivation) Theory and Social Cognitive Theory in that it emphasizes increasing intrinsic motivation and behavioral skills for PA. Adolescents in the intervention take part in developing the program, selecting physical activities that generate fun and interest, and generating their own coping strategies for making effective PA changes during a videotaped session. Preliminary data from our group demonstrates the feasibility of the motivational plus behavioral skills PA program for increasing moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) in underserved adolescents in South Carolina. The proposed project will use a school-based nested cohort design to evaluate efficacy of a 17-week motivational plus behavioral skills program versus typical after-school program (general health education only) on increasing PA in underserved adolescents. Twenty-four middle schools (70 6th graders per school; N=1,680), located in South Carolina will be randomly assigned to one of two after-school programs. The study employs a nested cohort design, with schools, rather than individuals assigned to condition and will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis of covariance techniques as outlined by Murray. We will also examine psychosocial variables (PA self-efficacy, self-concept, motivation, social support, and enjoyment) as potential mediators of the intervention on changes in MVPA using regression and structural equation modeling techniques.

Primary care plays an important role in efforts to prevent and intervene early in the course of child and adolescent mental health problems. While research with adults has shown the feasibility of integrating mental health care into primary care settings, there have been few studies among children and youth. Evidence remains lacking that integration is feasible in diverse settings, that it improves outcomes, and that methods can be developed to address the mixed symptoms of emerging child/youth problems and their overlap with developmental and parental disorders. Goals: The purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness of adding a child/youth mental health component into an existing collaborative care program for adult mental health problems. The work will refine a framework for efficient cultural adaption and tailoring of an existing child/youth primary care mental health intervention and then test whether the tailored intervention results in improved child and parent outcomes. The work will also provide evidence about the mechanisms by which those outcomes are achieved and what factors influence uptake of the child/youth component by general practitioners (GPs). These results should be generalizable to low and middle income countries and to underserved areas of the US where there are minimal child mental health resources and family physicians provide the bulk of medical care for children and youth. Methods: The planned work involves the adaptation/tailoring process followed by a trial with 45 GPs already engaged in collaborative care for adults; the trial will study adding collaborative care for children ages 5-15. GPs will be randomly assigned in groups to begin 6-month control periods involving child mental health screening and referral. They will then receive child/youth training and begin second 6-month periods of screening plus ongoing coaching and booster sessions and collaborative management. Primary outcomes will be measured by recruiting and following for 6 months two cohorts of children/youth and their parents (one control, one collaborative care).

NCT01048801,FALSE,cluster RCT,Role and Effectiveness of Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Home-based Management of Malaria,"Most malaria deaths occur within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, and in rural areas with poor access to health facilities, home management of malaria (HMM) can improve the timeliness of treatment and reduce malaria mortality by up to 50%. In order to maximize both coverage and impact, ACTs should be deployed in HMM programmes, as well as in formal health facilities. Up to 80% of malaria cases are treated outside the formal health sector and shops are frequently visited as the first (and in some cases only) source of treatment. Strategies to deploy ACTs in Africa thus also need to examine the role of shops in home management and to ensure that drugs sold are appropriate. The current practice of presumptive treatment of any febrile illness as malaria (both at health facilities and in the context of HMM) based solely on clinical symptoms without routine laboratory confirmation, results in significant over-use of antimalarial drugs. With ACT being a more costly regimen, it is important to be more restrictive in its administration and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) provide a simple means of confirming malaria diagnosis in remote locations lacking electricity and qualified health staff. This study therefore proposes to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of using RDTs to improve malaria diagnosis and treatment by community-based drug distributors.The accuracy of RDTs, and the acceptability of this approach, will be evaluated in both low and high transmission areas.",Role and Effectiveness of Rapid Diagnostic Tests in Home-based Management of Malaria: Comparative Trials in Two Areas of High and Low Transmission in Uganda,Fever; Malaria,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2000,2000,NA,2000,NA,Completed,Completed,NA,Device; Other,Rapid diagnostic test; presumptive malaria treatment,NA,NA,NA

Overall, infections account for one-third of all neonatal deaths, with proportions approaching 50% in settings where neonatal mortality rates are high. Infections are predominately due to sepsis, respiratory infections, tetanus, and diarrhea. The investigators long term goal is to identify simple, affordable, and effective interventions that can be delivered at the community level in low-resource settings to reduce neonatal mortality risk due to these infections. The investigators team has conducted research in this area for the past 10 years, with specific focus on newborn vitamin A dosing and topical chlorhexidine antisepsis interventions. Previous community-based research by the investigators group of investigators and others demonstrated that newborn vitamin A dosing can reduce early infant mortality by approximately 20%, and that topical applications of chlorhexidine to the umbilical cord can prevent omphalitis and reduce neonatal mortality risk by 24%. Evidence is growing that neonatal skin plays an important role in protecting the newborn infant from invasive pathogens. Barrier function of the neonatal skin, however, is incomplete in newborn infants, especially those that are pre-term or of low birth weight. Full-body massage of newborns with mustard oil, practiced almost universally (~95%) in communities of south Asia, may further compromise skin barrier function through decreased structural integrity leading to increased trans-epidermal water loss and increased risk of percutaneous penetration by invasive pathogens. Loss of structural integrity is not seen after massage of neonatal skin with alternative topical emollients, including sunflower seed oil. Furthermore, sunflower seed oil has been shown to accelerate recovery of the skin barrier function, improve skin condition, and reduce the risk of both nosocomial infections and neonatal mortality among hospitalized newborns in low-resource settings. The specific hypothesis of this study is that substituting mustard oil with sunflower seed oil for topical applications during full body massage of newborns in the community will reduce neonatal mortality and morbidity by improving overall skin barrier function and reducing exposure to invasive pathogens.",Impact of Sunflower Seed Oil Massage on Neonatal Mortality and Morbidity in Nepal,Neonatal Mortality; Neonatal Sepsis,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29260,0,NA,0,NA,Completed,Completed,NA,Other; Other,Sunflower seed oil; Mustard seed oil,NA,NA,NA

Children who are initiated on ART in Kenya and other low resource settings face several challenges with ongoing care due to current limitations of paediatric HIV treatment services. High quality paediatric HIV care requires routine monitoring of clinical and virologic status, support for ART adherence, and patient outreach to optimize retention in care. The HIV Infant Tracking System (HITSystem) is a web-based, system-level intervention that has dramatically improved EID HIV-related outcomes in Kenya, Tanzania, and Malawi. The objective of this study is to implement and evaluate the impact of HITSystem 3.0 on paediatric clinical outcomes, adherence, retention and viral suppression over 12 months among children in HIV care. Outcome measurements will be evaluated separately in children aged ≤2 years and in those aged 3-16 years. Primary Outcomes 1. The proportion of HIV infected children in each arm who are retained in HIV care at 12 months. Retention will be defined as regular engagement with HIV care, as measured by having attended the last three scheduled monthly appointments on time (see section 3.3 for further description). 2. The proportion of HIV infected children who are virally suppressed (VL <50) at the end of the 12-month follow-up period. The proposed trial design is an unblinded CRT with two arms: the HITSystem 3.0 Intervention vs. Standard of Care (SOC) as the control. The CRT will be implemented in 20 health facilities (10 intervention and 10 control) in Western Nyanza province in Kenya and will collect data from HIV-infected children aged ≤16 years. Outcomes will focus on ART retention, adherence and viral suppression. Outcomes will be assessed among all HIV positive children aged ≤16 years attending the trial facilities for HIV care at the start of the trial, or who are diagnosed as HIV positive during the first 12 months of the trial. Follow-up data will be collected on each child for 12 months. Therefore, the total duration of the trial will be for 24 months. All HIV-positive children and their caregivers attending health facilities randomised to the intervention arm will be monitored by the HITSystem 3.0.

The use of the Health Care Access Permanence Services (PASS) is intended to facilitate access to the health care system for people in precarious situations with care and social support within and outside the institutions. health. The hypothesis tested is that the use of a formalized tool makes it possible to improve the detection of pediatric social vulnerability and to overcome reluctance to practice by a simple, rapid and justified approach with regard to ongoing care. The primary objective is to validate a clinical tool for screening for pediatric social and health vulnerability - Tool: VUlnerable Child (ENVU) -; to allow for an appropriate orientation of the patient care pathway. The metrological validation of diagnostic performances (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios) will be studied in confrontation with the opinion of an expert caregiver in the care of vulnerable populations.

Vectors in SSA are often anthropophagic and anthropophilic, and exhibit indoor biting and indoor resting behavior. Highly effective interventions against vectors have been developed and implemented at scale (e.g., indoor Residual Spraying of Insecticides [IRS] and Long Lasting Insecticide-treated Nets [LLINs]). While these interventions have contributed importantly to the reduction of malaria transmission and disease (68% and 11% respectively), none of them target outdoor-biting g and outdoor-resting mosquitoes. Given the increase in resistance to current generation of insecticides and the behavioral plasticity of vectors that results in continued malaria transmission despite high coverage of LLINs or IRS, there is a need for interventions that can supplement and complement LLINs and IRS by killing mosquitoes outside houses using other biologic mechanisms (e.g., targeting sugar feeding behavior). Finally, insecticides with novel modes of action that may be capable of restoring sensitivity to pyrethroids by killing both pyrethroid resistant and sensitive mosquitoes are required. Attractive Target Sugar Baits (ATSBs) that kill mosquitoes through the ingestion of the toxicant dinotefuran (and possibly by other ingestion toxicants that are effective when ingested) potentially fill the need for outdoor interventions with novel killing effects.

In general, these programs target women and are designed to improve maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes through three primary pathways: 1. Increasing the availability of micronutrient-rich foods through increased household production of these foods; 2. Raising income through the sale of surplus production; and 3. Increasing knowledge and adoption of optimal nutrition practices, including the consumption of micronutrient-rich foods. Evaluations of HFP programs have consistently demonstrated significant increases in household production and consumption of micronutrient-rich foods. This increased consumption, along with improvements in health and nutrition related knowledge, and increased income, could all contribute to improvements in maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes. However, to date there has been limited understanding as to how these types of programs can be optimized to maximize impacts on these outcomes. In order to better understand the potential of these types of programs to improve maternal and child health and nutrition outcomes and how this impact may be achieved IFPRI has been collaborating with HKI to evaluate one of their E-HFP programs in Burkina Faso.

NCT01430247,FALSE,NA,Vision Screening for the Detection of Amblyopia,"INTRODUCTION. Amblyopia is defined as the loss of visual acuity (VA) in one or both eyes, without any obvious structural or pathological anomalies. Amblyopic eye should be able to regain some VA if treatment is initiated before the age of seven. It is the leading cause of monocular blindness in the 20- to 70-year olds with prevalence 2-5%. Amblyopia is mainly monocular, hence children are general asymptomatic. VA testing is the only reliable method of detecting amblyopia, and the fourth year of life is considered best for vision screening programs. AIM: The purpose of the study is to reduce the preventable vision loss. The main goal of the study is to evidence the problem of amblyopia in Zagreb and to release a model for formal, government directed vision-screening program as a Croatian public health policy. HYPOTHESIS. In Croatia, the prevalence and actual effect of amblyopia and amblyogenic factors, along with treatment efficacy is impossible to quantify, since no population-based studies have been performed regarding this issue. In addition, national screening of preschool children does not exist, while the school-entry screening is prescribed by law. The object of the study is to determine the prevalence of amblyopia in a 4-4.5 year old children of The Town of Zagreb, the efficacy of screening and effectiveness of treatment on reducing amblyopia prevalence. The primary hypothesis is defined: screening of visual acuity monocularly at distance and near in 4-4.5 year old children in Zagreb is effective in detecting amblyopia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocular vision of about 7000 children/ year aged 4-4.5 for whom both parents gave consent is to be tested with Lea chart at near (40cm) and distance (3m) in the kindergartens of The Town of Zagreb.

Intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) with antimalarial drugs given to all children once a month during the transmission season is a promising new strategy for malaria prevention. Studies in Senegal, Ghana, Mali and The Gambia have shown this approach can be highly effective. In Senegal, seasonal IPT with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) and one dose of artesunate resulted in a 90% reduction in incidence of clinical malaria in a recent trial in Senegal (Cisse et al., Lancet 2006). The purpose of the present project is to determine the public health impact and cost effectiveness of this intervention when it is delivered through the routine health service to communities in rural areas in Senegal. Demographic surveillance will be set up in the rural population of three districts (Mbour, Bambey and Fatick) which comprises approximately 540,000 people, including 100,000 children under 5 yrs, and is served by 54 health posts, as an expansion of the area covered by the existing DSS of Niakhar. Information about births, deaths and migrations, household characteristics such as socioeconomic status, and vaccination status of children and their use of bednets, will be recorded in 6-monthly rounds of all households. In selected areas, deaths among children under 10 years will be investigated using verbal autopsies. Over four years from September 2008 - November 2011, seasonal IPT (three monthly administrations of SP (sulfalene-pyrimethamine) plus amodiaquine during the transmission season each year to children 3-59 months of age) will be introduced gradually, in a step-wedge design, by 9 health posts in 2008, by an additional 18 posts in 2009, and another 18 in 2010 and 9 in 2011. At the end of each transmission season, a cross-sectional survey of 2400 children under 5 yrs of age, in which finger prick blood samples will be taken, will be used to estimate the prevalence of molecular markers of drug resistance to Plasmodium falciparum, the prevalence of anaemia and the nutritional status of children.

NCT01800266,FALSE,NA,Randomized Controlled Trial of Supervision Strategies to Improve Clinician Fidelity to Trauma-focused CBT,"The primary goal of this study is to examine the impact of varying supervision strategies on clinician fidelity and client outcomes in a community-based setting. Prior research has established that training approaches that do not include a period of intervention-specific supervision or consultation are ineffective and that implementation efforts that include only an initial period of supervision show an eventual attenuation of gains in knowledge and fidelity in practice. Ongoing supervision may be required for effective and sustained implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in community-based settings. However, supervision is one of the least investigated aspects of training. ""Gold standard"" elements of supervision from efficacy trials include review of sessions, standardized procedures for monitoring client outcomes and model fidelity, and ongoing skill-building (e.g., behavioral rehearsal). The degree (e.g., frequency, intensity) to which these strategies are used in community-based settings is unknown. There are a growing number of national and statewide efforts to increase the reach of EBPs through dissemination and implementation initiatives. There are 18 statewide initiatives to implement Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), an EBP for child trauma exposure and sequelae. Many of the community based TF-CBT implementation efforts, and those for other EBPs, include a specific focus on supervisors. However, the limited scientific literature provides very little guidance for these efforts. Aims of the current trial include 1) studying supervision with existing implementation supports; particularly presence of gold standard elements; 2) evaluating the effects of varying supervision strategies on fidelity and client outcomes; and 3) testing the mediating effect of treatment fidelity on the relationship between supervision type and client outcomes.

NCT00971958,FALSE,NA,"Infant Male Circumcision in Gaborone, Botswana, and Surrounding Areas: Feasibility, Safety and Acceptability","Background: Novel HIV prevention approaches are urgently needed in Botswana and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Although adult male circumcision (MC) has been shown to reduce the heterosexual acquisition of HIV by men by about 60%, MC in infancy is optimal for its relative ease, lower cost and low rate of complications. We have conducted focus groups and semi-structured interviews that suggest neonatal MC (< 28 days of life) would be an acceptable public HIV prevention strategy in Botswana. The government of Botswana is committed to scaling up MC services in the immediate future and they plan to include neonates. Understanding decision-making around infant MC will be essential to maximize the effectiveness of this HIV prevention strategy. Specific Aims: The investigators propose to: 1) determine the acceptability and actual uptake of neonatal MC in southeastern Botswana and identify barriers to uptake; 2) ascertain the feasibility and safety of neonatal MC in Botswana; 3) Estimate what, if any, advantages would exist for scale up of Mogen Clamp, Plastibell or AccuCirc with regard to human resources, equipment needs, adverse events and acceptability to health-care providers and families in Botswana. Study Design and Schema: The investigators will conduct structured interviews with early postpartum mothers and fathers to determine correlates of neonatal MC acceptability and uptake, defined as neonatal MC following informed consent. Male infants will be circumcised by a trained doctor in a hospital / clinic setting by one of three FDA-approved devices that are currently in use in US hospitals: Mogen clamp, Plastibell or AccuCirc. Circumcision with Mogen Clamp or Plastibell will be done before 29 days of life. Circumcision with AccuCirc will be done before 11 days of life (FDA approval limit for device). The investigators will also administer questionnaires to the parents at the regular pediatric follow-up visit(s) to assess impressions of / satisfaction with the infant's procedure outcome over time. Provider impressions of the three methods will also be evaluated. Sample size will be 150 infants per arm for a total of 450 infants males circumcised (and an estimated 800 parental questionnaires). Public Health Significance: The World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS state that countries with severe, generalized HIV epidemics but low rates of MC should offer this surgery as an important, evidence-based HIV prevention intervention, including among neonates. These two agencies also recommended that additional research on the most feasible, safe, and sustainable ways of scaling up MC intervention should be performed. This study will be in keeping with these recommendations. Please note the Mogen clamp and Plastibell study arms began as a randomized trial before the initiation of the AccuCirc single-arm portion. Although the settings in which the three devices were studied were similar, the AccuCirc trial enrollment began at two sites (Gaborone and Molepolole) only after completion of the Mogen clamp and Plastibell arms, which was conducted in three sites (Gaborone, Molepolole and Mochudi). Although Lobatse was a site for the first acceptability study with mothers, no procedures were performed there. Regarding the reported sample size: the total, final sample size includes both parents of newborn boys (because enrolled consenting parents completed questionnaires as part of this study), and boys whose parents consented to circumcision. We anticipated that not all parents who completed the questionnaire would consent to circumcising their baby; therefore, when planning the study it was necessary to estimate the number of parents who would participate in the survey (700), to achieve an enrollment of 300 neonates (therefore the initial estimate of 1000). The original study in fact enrolled 302 infants, 600 mothers and 19 fathers (total study population 921). The addition of the AccuCirc arm led to a revised estimate of total number of neonates and their parents (total=1250). The final enrollment was of 1,235 participants, that includes all the participating neonates and parents.","Infant Male Circumcision in Gaborone, Botswana, and Surrounding Areas: Feasibility, Safety and Acceptability",HIV Infections; Circumcision,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1235,1235,NA,1235,NA,Completed,Completed,NA,Procedure; Device; Device; Device,Circumcision; Mogen Clamp; Plastibell; AccuCirc,NA,NA,NA

NCT02888457,FALSE,NA,Carriage of Streptococcus Pneumoniae in Infants With Acute Otitis Media and in Infants Attending Day-care Centers,"Rationale In Belgium, a unique situation exists for two reasons: on the one hand, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) program, which started in 2007, has quickly reached high coverage in infants: 3-dose coverage rose from 89 % in 2008 to 96.5 % in 2012 in Flanders and from 80.7 % in 2009 to 89.2 % in 2012 in Wallonia; and on the other hand, serotype coverage has moved from PCV7 (since 2007) to PCV13 (since 2011) and very recently to PCV10 (since July 2015 in Flanders and expected in May 2016 in the French Community). Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) surveillance has demonstrated a major impact on PCV13 serotypes in infants < 2 years of age. The impact of the current change in PCV-program is hard to predict, but could eventually result in a re-emergence of serotypes not covered by PCV10 (i.e. 3, 6A and 19A). With this unique situation the foundation was laid for a carriage study during which the nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumonia (Sp) and other common colonizers of the nasopharynx will be studied in infants with acute otitis media (AOM) and in healthy infants attending day-care centers (DCC), two populations with high reported pneumococcal carriage. Young children are an important reservoir and major source of transmission of bacteria to the whole community and thus the preferred population to study nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage. Aim of the study The main aim of this study is to evaluate if changes in the conjugate anti-pneumococcal vaccination program in Belgium have an impact on the nasopharyngeal carriage of Pneumococcus in infants aged 6-30 months suffering from AOM or attending day-care, in order to guide future pneumococcal vaccine program decisions and vaccine development, and to feed AOM treatment guidelines in a PCV-program environment. The study will monitor overall pneumococcal carriage, the serotypes involved and the sensitivity of the isolated strains to antibiotics. In addition, the rhinopharyngeal carriage of other common nasopharyngeal colonizers associated with disease, in particular Haemophilus influenzae, will be studied in order to evaluate if changes in pneumococcal carriage impact on the carriage of those pathogens. In infants with AOM, the study will also monitor the clinical course of the AOM and a second nasopharyngeal sample will be taken in case of antibiotic treatment failure or AOM recurrence to identify any association with the carried pathogen.",Assessment of the Nasopharyngeal Carriage of Streptococcus Pneumoniae (Sp) and Other Common Pathogens in Infants (6-30 Months of Age) With Acute Otitis Media and in Healthy Infants (6-30 Months of Age) Attending Day-care Centers,Streptococcus Pneumoniae; Nasopharyngeal Carriage,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5000,0,NA,0,NA,Unknown status,Unknown status,NA,Other,Nasopharyngeal sampling with a swab,NA,NA,NA

The intervention will include the giving the vegetables descriptive names, moving the fruit to right next to the register and in attractive bowls, and increasing the amount of white milk served by 10%. The main forms of analyzing these results are through food preparation records, lunch sales records, and tray waste records. The first focus of this study is to see if there is a specific point in an intervention when improvement stops and therefore the intervention needs to be updated. This procedure involves looking at five similar middle schools with this same intervention over a 15 week period. The time of intervention implementation will vary by three week intervals, so the first will start the first week of school, the next school will start after three weeks of school, the next will start after six weeks of school, and the next will start after nine weeks of school, and the last will be a control school where there will be no intervention implementation. These intervals will help eliminate bias dealing with the beginning of the year excitement and seasonal effects. Food preparation records and lunch sales records will be collected from the school for the 15 week period. Tray waste will be recorded by having 200 randomly selected trays measured and collected twice a week over the 15 week period.

While the main goal of cash transfer programs is to reduce poverty, they also have the potential to improve many development outcomes, such as health and education. While many studies, mainly in Latin America and Asia, have investigated the impacts of CTs on poverty and food security and have, for the most part, found positive impacts, less is known about the impacts of CTs in Africa south of the Sahara, and, in particular, West Africa. Moreover, despite the fact that cash transfers have been shown to lead to decreases in poverty, improvements in household food security, and increases in health service utilization, impacts on children's nutritional status (including anthropometric measures) are generally small (Manley, Gitter, and Slavchevska 2013). Consequently, policymakers and governments are left with the question of how to design social safety nets, such as cash transfers, to achieve greater impact on diet quality, health, and nutrition. The overall goal of this research is to generate evidence and knowledge on an integrated program implemented by the Government of Mali that includes a combination of cash transfers and targeted nutrition interventions. The information generated will inform program implementers and policymakers about best options to improve food security and nutrition among vulnerable groups and individuals in West Africa. Specifically, the main objectives of the research are 1. To provide evidence on the contribution of integrated social transfer programs to enhancing household welfare, food security, dietary diversity, and maternal and child nutrition in West Africa. 2. To test different features and combinations of cash transfers and targeted nutrition interventions, and assess their impact on food security and maternal and child nutrition and health outcomes in Mali. 3.

NCT00146692,FALSE,NA,A Trial of Improved Financial Access to Healthcare in Ghana,"Effective control strategies for malaria depend both on preventing disease and on treating those who become infected to prevent significant morbidity and mortality. There are many barriers to preventing access to prompt and effective treatment, some of which are amenable to intervention, others (such as distance to healthcare) less so. This study will concentrate on modifiable financial barriers to care. With the aim of increasing health service utilization and reducing morbidity and mortality among children under five, some governments are currently implementing policies aimed at reducing financial barriers to health care. There is at the same time an on-going debate concerning the relative importance of cost as a barrier to health care. Though theoretically the aim for reducing these barriers should be achieved, its actual impact has not been directly assessed or demonstrated by means of an intervention trial. This study aims to determine by means of a randomized trial the impact of reducing such barriers on morbidity due to severe malaria among children 6 months to five years and on outpatient utilization. An existing pre-payment scheme in the study area will be utilized to improve financial access for half of 2500 households who have not registered for either year I or II. The impact on severe anaemia, mean haemoglobin and anthropometric measurements will be assessed. Health service utilisation rates will be measured in both groups by active and passive surveillance. Patient perceptions and health-seeking behaviour will be compared. The study will contribute to the current debate on the relative importance of cost of care as a barrier to health care and the potential for the removal of this barrier as a strategy for malaria control, and on methods to optimise this.",Impact of Improved Financial Access to Health Care on Morbidity Due to Severe Malaria and Healthcare Utilization Among Children 6 Months to Five Years of Age in a Hyper Endemic Area in Ghana: a Randomized Controlled Trial,Malaria,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2000,0,NA,0,NA,Completed,Completed,NA,Behavioral,Free medical treatment,NA,NA,NA

Face mask ventilation (FMV) is the most common method of resuscitating neonates in such settings. It is mostly performed by midwives but may not always be satisfactory. The i-gel® is a cuffless supraglottic airway which is easy to insert and provides an efficient seal that prevents air leakage with the potential to enhance the performance of neonatal resuscitation. Midwives can be trained in a short time to use this method. A pilot study in Uganda has demonstrated that midwives can safely perform resuscitation of newborn with the i-gel. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the use of a cuffless supraglottic airway compared to face-mask ventilation during neonatal resuscitation can reduce early neonatal death (before 7 days of life) or morbidity in neonatal encephalopathy (NE) in asphyxiated neonates. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING AND POPULATION A multi-centre randomized clinical trial will be conducted at Central Hospital, Beira, Mozambique and at Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, among asphyxiated neonates in the delivery units. Prior to the intervention, all staff in the labour ward performing resuscitation will receive training according to the HBB curriculum with a special module for training on supraglottic airway insertion.

NCT03831906,FALSE,NA,TB-Speed Pneumonia,"Despite progress in reducing tuberculosis (TB) incidence and mortality in the past 20 years, TB is a top ten cause of death in children under 5 years worldwide. However, childhood TB remains massively underreported and undiagnosed, mostly because of the challenges in confirming its diagnosis due to the paucibacillary nature of the disease and the difficulty in obtaining expectorated sputum in children. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years worldwide. There is growing evidence that, in high TB burden settings, TB is common in children with pneumonia, with up to 23% of those admitted to hospital with an initial diagnosis of pneumonia later being diagnosed as TB. However, the current WHO standard of care (SOC) for young children with pneumonia considers a diagnosis of TB only if the child has a history of prolonged symptoms or fails to respond to antibiotic treatments. Hence, TB is often under-diagnosed or diagnosed late in children presenting with pneumonia. In this context, the investigators are proposing to assess the impact on mortality of adding the systematic early detection of TB using Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra, performed on NPAs and stool samples, to the WHO SOC for children with severe pneumonia, followed by immediate initiation of anti-TB treatment in children testing positive on any of the samples. TB-Speed Pneumonia is a multicentric, stepped wedge diagnostic trial conducted in six countries with high TB incidence: Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Uganda, Mozambique, Zambia and Cambodia.",Impact of Systematic Early Tuberculosis (TB) Detection Using Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra in Children With Severe Pneumonia in High Tuberculosis Burden Countries,Tuberculosis; Severe Pneumonia,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3780,0,NA,0,NA,Recruiting,Recruiting,NA,Diagnostic Test,Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra (Ultra),NA,NA,NA
NCT02341469,FALSE,NA,A Trial of an Integrated E-diagnosis Assessment to Improve the Management of Childhood Illnesses in Burkina Faso,"In 2010, one in six children in Burkina Faso died before the age of five, mainly due to lack of access to quality health care services. Most of these deaths could have been avoided through cost-effective interventions. Ensuring that sick children receive adequate care in a country where 80% of the population lives in rural areas requires improved accessibility and high quality primary health care services. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses strategy (IMCI) was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in the 1990s and is an excellent way to improve the quality of country's child health services. However, in Burkina Faso IMCI suffers from a low level of adherence by health workers. According to a recent evaluation by the Ministry of Health (MoH), only 8.2% of children had benefited in 2012 from an consultation using IMCI guideline. Moreover, an analysis of children's records showed that only 15% of IMCI consultations were being correctly delivered and, for instance, only 34% of children with pneumonia who needed an antibiotic were prescribed the correct treatment. The obstacles to IMCI adoption in Burkina Faso are diverse and include inadequate training methods, shortage of material (papers, forms), lack of quality supervision by district executive teams, lack of integration between IMCI monitoring tools and the national health information system etc. The Integrated eDiagnosis Approach (IeDA) aims to address the poor quality of child health services in Burkina Faso by increasing the level of adherence to IMCI guidelines. IeDA is an innovative strategy combining information and communication technologies (using the Registre Electronique des Consultations [REC], an electronic IMCI patient record designed by Terre des hommes, Tdh) and a quality improvement approach. The approach has been piloted over three years in two different districts in the north of Burkina Faso, Tougan and Séguénéga. This medium scaling-up demonstration project will combine implementation and research components with a goal to enable national scaleup. Terre des hommes is in charge of the implementation of the project and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) will coordinate the research component of the study in partnership with Centre Muraz. The primary hypothesis is that the Integrated eDiagnosis Approach will lead to improved adherence to IMCI guidelines and management of childhood illnesses in two regions (with a target of 75% of correct diagnoses and prescriptions).",Integrated eDiagnosis Assessment (IeDA) for Children Under Five Years Old: a Stepped-wedge Randomized Cluster Trial of a Quality Improvement of the Management of Children Illnesses in Burkina Faso at the Primary Health Care Level,IMCI Guidelines; Childhood Illnesses,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7200,0,NA,0,NA,Completed,Completed,NA,Other,integrated ediagnostic approach (IeDA),NA,NA,NA
NCT03143283,FALSE,NA,An ED-based RCT of Lethal Means Counseling for Parents of At-Risk Youth,"The National Action Alliance to Prevent Suicide recently released a research agenda aimed at significantly reducing suicide over the next decade. Aspirational Goal 12, ""Reduce access to lethal means that people use to attempt suicide,"" calls for identifying effective strategies to reduce a suicidal person's access to firearms and other lethal means. A promising strategy is to counsel patients seen in the emergency department (ED) for a psychiatric emergency to reduce access to firearms (the most lethal suicide method) and medications (the most common method of suicide attempt). To date, however, few studies have evaluated changes in firearm storage practices among those who received lethal means counseling (LMC), and those that have, including a pilot conducted in Colorado by the study team, have lacked control groups. Results from the pilot, which provided emergency department based LMC counseling to parents of suicidal adolescents, found that among gun-owning parents, 33% had unlocked guns at home on the day of the ED visit and none did on follow up. Using the piloted LMC protocol, we will conduct the first randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of ED-based LMC on firearm and medication storage. The proposed RCT, to be conducted in five Colorado hospitals, will test whether parents of at-risk adolescents who are treated in hospitals that have (vs. have not yet) implemented our LMC protocol are more likely to store household firearms and medications safely. In addition, we will conduct in-depth, qualitative interviews with parents who have received LMC counseling to better understand those factors that affect parents' willingness and ability to make changes to firearm and medication storage. We will also conduct qualitative interviews with clinicians to understand factors affecting clinician engagement in LMC. AIM 1: To assess the effectiveness of an ED-based LMC intervention to improve how parents of pediatric patients (age 10-17) who visit the ED for a mental health emergency store household firearms and medication. AIM 2: To examine how attitudinal and contextual factors shape a) parents' decisions about firearm and medication storage following LMC, and b) clinicians' delivery of LMC messages.",An ED-based Randomized Clinical Trial of Lethal Means Counseling for Parents of Youth at Risk for Suicide,Suicidal and Self-injurious Behavior,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,Other,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1500,0,NA,0,NA,Recruiting,Recruiting,NA,Behavioral,Safety Study Lethal Means Counseling,NA,NA,NA
